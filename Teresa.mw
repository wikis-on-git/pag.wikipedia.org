As of the year 2010, there was a proposal to name the eastern section of the municipality as a 10th barangay (the area from the Marcos Highway towards General Nakar in Quezon Province). However, the area is part of the disputed political claim among the municipalities of Teresa, Baras, and Tanay.

==Historiya==
Teresa was first named "Oroquieta" and was a barrio of the Municipality of Morong. As a non-independent town its name was changed to "Santa Rosa" in honor of the town's patron saint, [[Saint Rose of Lima]]. Against the will of its people, Santa Rosa was annexed to Antipolo, which led to animosity between the two towns. Most of the residents preferred to be under jurisdiction of Morong.

Unstable conditions led militant leaders such as Messra. San Esteban, Santo Domuingo, Pio Piriquiquit Santos, Raymundo Francisco, Mariano Celo Francisco, Diego P. Cruz, Santiago P. Cruz, Sabino de Ramos, Platon Gonzales, Brigido Capli Cruz,Lorenzo Capli Cruz, Saturnino Francisco, and Francisco Natividad to clamor for independence. In 1877 the Spanish lawyer Don Mariano Rodriguez Candelaria assisted the people in appealing to the Spanish Governor General for separate ownership. The appeal was given preferential attention, and Santa Rosa was later declared an independent town. In 1900 the people agreed to change the name from Santa Rosa to "Teresa" in honor of the Spanish lawyer's mother, Doña Teresa Candelaria. 

In 1903 when rebellion broke out, Teresa was again annexed to the Municipality of Antipolo. In 1917, the able men of the town again moved for independence with the help of the Provincial Governor, Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. This move, however, failed due to political reasons.

With the help extended by Senator Rafael Palma, the independence of Teresa was approved and declared by the Governor-General Charles E. Yeater on January 1, 1919 through Executive Order No. 57 (signed December 16, 1918). Roberto de Jesus was appointed as the first "Municipal President" (known as ''Mayor'' today). Functioning as a town, Teresa comprised three barrios at the time: May-Iba, Pantay, and Saint Roche.

After three years of independence, the town acquired a municipal building on November 8, 1921, which was called ''Presedencia''. Paulino de la Rosa was the second Municipal President of Teresa, Rizal. During his term the elementary school building (located in Dalig) was inaugurated. His portrait hangs proudly as the first in the grand entrance of the municipal building in Teresa, Rizal.
