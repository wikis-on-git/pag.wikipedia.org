===Physical===

Almost the whole region is situated in the mountainous [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] range. Located there is [[Mount Pulag]], the second highest mountain in the country, rising at 2,922 meters. Various rivers start here, like the [[Cagayan River]] and the [[Agno River]].

==Tourist attractions==

Tourist attractions in the region include the world famous [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in the province of [[Ifugao]]. This is supposedly considered as the "Eighth Wonder of the World". Natural attractions of the region include the Sumaguing Cave in Sagada and the mummy caves of [[Benguet]] and [[Mt. Province]]. There are four National Parks: Cassamata Hill, [[Mount Pulag]] (the second highest mountain in the Philippines with an elevation of 2,922 meters above sea level), Mt. Data and Balbalasang-Balbalan, located in the province of Kalinga. Kalinga is also offering world class white water rafting along the chico river.

==History==

On [[July 15]], [[1987]], Executive Order No. 220 was issued creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province. [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 6766 was passed on [[October 23]], [[1989]]. It provided for an Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. It mandates the creation of an autonomous government to be headed by a Regional Governor. It creates a Regional Assembly that will enact laws of regional application and a regional judiciary composed of a supreme court and lower courts. The act also directs the proposed autonomous government in the Cordillera to exercise governmental functions, including the raising of taxes, but excluding defense, foreign affairs and monetary functions. However, the Constitution requires that the act has to be ratified by the people in a plebiscite. It was originally scheduled on [[December 27]] of the same year but was reset to [[January 30]] the following by virtue of the Commission on Elections. During the said plebiscite, it was only Ifugao which voted favorably.

Republic Act No. 8438 dated [[December 22]], [[1997]] created the Cordillera Autonomous Region. In [[January]] [[1998]], a group of lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the act. A plebiscite held on March 9 of the same year was held and invalidated the act. The region was created but reduced to a regular administrative region.
