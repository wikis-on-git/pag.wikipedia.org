|IPA]]:}} {{IPA|[ˌvɛnɪˈzweɪlə]}}; {{lang-es|Venezuela}}, IPA: {{IPA|[beneˈswela]}}) is a country on the northern [[tropics|tropical]] [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[South America]]. Venezuela borders [[Brazil]] to the south, [[Guyana]] to the east, and [[Colombia]] to the west. North of the Venezuelan coast lie the islands of [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

A former [[Spanish colony]], Venezuela is a [[federal republic]]. Historically, Venezuela has had territorial disputes with [[Guyana]], largely concerning the [[Essequibo]] area, and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. Today, Venezuela is known widely for its [[petroleum]] industry, the [[biodiversity|environmental diversity]] of its territory, and its sheer natural beauty. [[Christopher Columbus]] was so enthralled by Venezuela's landscape, when arriving to its coast in [[1498]], that he referred to the land as '''''Tierra de Gracia''''' (''Land of Grace''), which has become the country’s nickname.

==Origin of name==
[[Image:palafito.jpg|left|thumb|190px|A palafito, like the ones seen by Amerigo Vespucci]]
The name ''Venezuela'' is believed to have originated from the cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] who, together with Alonso de Ojeda, led a [[1499]] naval expedition along the northwestern coast (known today as the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]). On reaching the [[Guajira Peninsula]], the crew observed the distinctive stilt villages (''[[palafitos]]'') that the indigenous Añu people had built over the water. This reminded Vespucci of the city of [[Venice]] ("Venezia" in Italian) and as a result the region was named ''Veneziela''; some argue this meant ''Little Venice'' and later evolved to "Venezuela". Other historians (notably Francisco Herrera Luque), noted that the suffix ''-zuela'' usually has a pejorative meaning in the Spanish language (''mujerzuela'', ''cazuela'', etc.) and sustain the thesis that the name implied more the notion of a second-rate Venice. 

On the other hand, the Spanish geographer Martín Fernández de Enciso, a member of the same crew, says in his work ''Summa de Geografía'' that the aforementioned population was called ''Veneciuela'', and that it was built on a large, plain rock. According to this theory, the name ''Venezuela'' could be a native word. Nevertheless, the first account remains by far the most popular and accepted version of the origin of the country's name.

==History of colonization==
{{main|History of Venezuela}}
[[Image:Simón Bolívar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Simón Bolívar]], ''El Libertador'']]
Venezuela was [[colonization|colonized]] by [[Spain]] in [[1522]]. In what is now the head of Cumaná,  [[Spain]] established their first permanent [[South America|South American]] settlement, and most of the territory eventually became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. Parts of what is now eastern Venezuela became [[New Andalusia]]. After several unsuccessful uprisings, the country declared independence from Spain on [[July 5th]] [[1811]] under the leadership of [[Francisco de Miranda]], a Venezuelan who was a marshal in the French Revolution. Nevertheless, full control over Venezuelan territory was achieved after Simón Bolívar, El Libertador, with the help of General [[José Antonio Páez]] and especially the then General [[marshal|Grand Marshall]] [[Antonio José de Sucre]], whose battle plan Bolívar chose to follow, won the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on [[June 24th]] [[1821]], and after [[José Prudencio Padilla]] won the [[Naval Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] on [[July 24th]] [[1823]]. 
[[Image:Castillo Santa Rosa 01.jpg|thumb|right|290px|The ''castillo Santa Rosa'' was a Spanish colonial fort used to defend [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]] from [[pirates]] and foreign invadors]]
New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army, he then led several countries to freedom and created a new republic called Colombia (also known as Great or Greater Colombia to differentiate it from the Republic of Colombia) consisting of what are now [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]] and Venezuela. He then led the army towards the south, liberating [[Peru]] and founding [[Bolivia]] (named after the Libertador, formerly a part of Peru, known as 'Alto Peru') from the Spaniards. [[Antonio José de Sucre]], who won many battles for Bolívar, was to become his natural successor, until he was murdered in Berruecos. Venezuela became, after the war of independence, along with Colombia and Ecuador, part of the [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] (''República de Gran Colombia'') until [[1830]], when the country separated through a rebellion led by [[José Antonio P]] and declared itself a sovereign [[republic]]. Páez became the first president of Venezuela.

Much of Venezuela's [[19th century|19th]]- and early [[20th century|20th-century]] history was characterized by political instability, political struggle and [[dictator]]ial rule.<ref name="LOC_2005_2-3">{{Harv|Library of Congress|2005|pp=2-3}}.</ref> Following the death of [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] in [[1935]] and the temporary demise of ''caudillismo'' (authoritarian rule), democratic struggles eventually forced the military to withdraw from direct involvement in national politics in [[1958]]. Since that year, Venezuela has enjoyed an unbroken tradition of democratic civilian rule, though even this has not been without conflict.

Venezuela is member of the [[South American Community of Nations]] ([[SACN]]). ''[[History of Venezuela|(more)]]''

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Venezuela}}
[[Image:National assembly building Caracas Venezuela.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The National Assembly Building in downtown [[Caracas]].]]
The [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan president]] is elected by vote, with direct and [[universal suffrage]], and functions as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The term of office is six years, and a president may be re-elected to a single consecutive term. The president appoints the vice-president and decides the size and composition of the [[cabinet]] and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.

The [[unicameral]] Venezuelan [[parliament]] is the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] or ''Asamblea Nacional''. Its 167 deputies, of which three are reserved for indigenous peoples, serve five-year terms and may be re-elected for a maximum of two additional terms. They are elected by popular vote through a combination of party lists and single member constituencies. The highest [[judiciary|judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] or ''Tribunal Supremo de Justicia'', whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single 12-year term. The [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (''Consejo Nacional Electoral'', or ''CNE'') is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly.

Venezuela abolished the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] in [[1863]], making it the country where this practice has been outlawed the longest.<ref>Amnesty International USA.

===New flag and new coat of arms===
Recent political change has resulted in  the [[flag of Venezuela]] being changed by the addition of an eighth star, symbolizing the Guayana's contributions to the independence of the nation. The [[coat of arms]] has been changed, with the horse facing to the left.

==Administrative divisions==
===States===
{{main|States of Venezuela}}
Venezuela is divided into 23 states (''estados''), a [[Venezuelan Capital District|capital district]] (''distrito capital'') correspondent to the city of [[Caracas]], the federal dependencies (''dependencias federales'') and Guayana Esequiba (border dispute/Guyana). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 [[municipality|municipalities]] (''municipios''), and further subdivided into 1,084 [[parish]]es (''parroquias'').

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Venezuela}}

At 352,121 [[square miles|mi²]] (912,050 [[square kilometre|km²]]),<ref> CIA Factbook.[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html Venezuela.] Accessed 20 September 2006.</ref> Venezuela is the world's 33rd-largest country (after [[Nigeria]]). It is comparable in size to [[Namibia]], and is about half the size of the US state of [[Alaska]].
[[Image:La Galera.jpg|thumb|right|200px|La Galera beach, [[Nueva Esparta]]]]
Venezuela is home to a wide variety of landscapes, such as the north-easternmost extensions of the [[Andes]] mountains in the northwest and along the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast, of which the highest point is the [[Pico Bolívar]] at 4,981 metres (16,341&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]).

[[Image:Angel falls.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Angel Falls]] (''Salto Ángel''), world's highest waterfall]] 

The center of the country is characterized by extensive plains known as the ''[[llanos]]'' that stretch from the Colombian border to the [[river delta]] of the [[Orinoco]] east. To the south are found the dissected [[Guiana|Guiana Highlands]], home to [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest [[waterfall]], <ref> Angel Falls. (2006). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved July 28, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007543 </ref> and the northern edge of [[Amazon Basin|Amazonia]].  Venezuela's forests are being depleted at the rate of about 200,000 hectares per annum through logging and [[shifting cultivation]][http://www.mongabay.com/deforestation.htm]. 

The country can also be divided into nine geographical areas, some corresponding to the natural regions, one being the [[Andes]] Range. The [[Lake Maracaibo]] region comprises the lowlands near the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. The [[Coro System]], a mountainous block in the northern occidental territory, is the fount of several [[sierra]]s and valleys. The [[Central Range, Venezuela|Central Range]] is tied up with the coast and the hills surrounding [[Caracas]], while the [[Eastern Range]], separated from the Central by the [[Gulf of Cariaco]], covers all of [[Sucre State]] and northern [[Monagas State|Monagas]]. The [[Llanos]] Region involves a third part of the country's area, above the [[Orinoco River]]. Under it, is the [[South Orinoco Region]] (the Guianas, above described). The [[Insular Region (geographical)|Insular Region]] is formed by [[Nueva Esparta]] and the [[Federal Dependencies]]. The last geographical region is the [[Deltaic System]] which forms a pantanous triangle, covering [[Delta Amacuro]], with the Atlantic platform branching off the coast.
[[Image:Humboldt-peak.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pico Humboldt|Humboldt Peak]], [[Mérida State|Mérida]].]]
The [[Orinoco River]] is the largest and most important river of the country, originating one of the biggest [[drainage basin|watershed]]s in Latin America. Other important rivers are the [[Caroní River (Venezuela)|Caroní]] and the [[Apure River|Apure]].

The local [[climate]] is tropical and generally hot and humid, though moderate and cold in the highlands. The capital, [[Caracas]] is also the country's largest city. Other major cities include [[Maracaibo]], [[Barquisimeto]], [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]], [[Maracay]], and [[Ciudad Guayana]].

Venezuela is one of the seventeen [[megadiverse countries]], for the great number of animal and vegetable species that habitate there.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Venezuela}}
[[Image:Billete 50000 bolívares anverso.jpg|300px|thumb|Venezuelan 50,000 bolívares banknote]]
The petroleum sector dominates the economy, accounting for roughly a third of Venezuela's [[GDP]], around 80% of export earnings, and more than half of government revenues. The oil sector operates through the government-owned [[Petroleos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA), which among other things owns the US-based distributor [[CITGO]], with more than 14,000 retail gasoline outlets in the United States under its brand.

Venezuela also depends highly on the agricultural sector. Sectors with major potential for export-led growth are production of both [[coffee]] and [[cocoa]] crops. At one time, Venezuela ranked close to Colombia in coffee production, but in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s|70s]], as petroleum temporarily turned Venezuela into the richest country in South America, coffee was relegated to the economic back burner. Today, Venezuela produces less than one percent of the world's coffee and most of it is drunk by the Venezuelans themselves. However, some interesting Venezuelan coffees are again entering the North American specialty market. Venezuela's cocoa industry has decayed since the days of Spanish colonialism, when African slaves toiled in these sweltering, snake-infested estates. The focus of cocoa cultivation has long since moved to tropical West Africa and Venezuela now grows under one per cent of the world crop. However, in recent years there has been an attempt to resuscitate this industry, as its rare variety of [[cacao]] is considered the finest and most aromatic in the world and is used in certain single origin chocolates. The largest company of fine chocolate in Venezuela is [[El Rey Chocolates|El Rey]], though such companies as Chocovic also sell chocolate with Venezuelan cacao.

Venezuela is one of the five founding members of [[OPEC]]. The idea itself (an international oil cartel) was the initiative of [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo]], who proposed it as a response to low domestic and international oil prices in August [[1960]]. Since [[December 2005]], Venezuela has been a member of [[Mercosur]], joining with [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], although it has yet to finalize policy changes in order to gain voting rights.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Altamira.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Caracas]], the capital city of Venezuela]]
{{main|Demographics of Venezuela}}
A recent study on racial groups showed that 60% of the population are mestizo (mixed race between white, black and indian), 29% caucasian, 8% black, 1% native indian and 2% asian (China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea).
The Venezuelan people comprise a combination of heritages.{{cn}} The historically present [[Amerindian]]s, [[Spain|Spanish]] colonists and imported [[African]] slaves were joined by [[Italy|Italians]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Arab]]s, [[ethnic German|Germans]], and others from neighbouring countries in [[South America]] during waves of immigration in the 20th century. There are also various communities from eastern Europe such as Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Hungary. There are also communties from [[China]] and [[Vietnam]]. About 85% of the population live in urban areas in the northern portion of the country. While almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the [[Orinoco]] river, this region contains only 5% of the population.

The national and official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but about 31 other indigenous languages also exist ([[Wayuu]], [[Pemon]], [[Warao]], [[Kariña]], [[Yanomami]], [[Guajibo]], etc), as do languages introduced by immigrants. 96% of the population is at least nominally [[Roman Catholic]]. Around 4% of the population adheres to other faiths.

==Public health==
[[Infant mortality]] in Venezuela stands at 21.54 deaths per 1000 births, for comparison this rate is almost eight times higher than [[Sweden]].  Child [[malnutrition]] (for children under age five) stands at about 17 percent of the population classified as stunted or wasted, which are the official [[United Nations]] categories for malnutrition.  Areas more affected by the stunting and wasting include some of the poorest populations: [[Delta Amacuro State|Amacuro Delta]] (30%) and [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas]] (24%).<ref> FAO.org  [http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/nutrition/ven-e.stm Venezuela.]  Accessed 20 September 2006.</ref>

==Culture & heritage==
[[Image:Joropo.jpg|thumb|200px|Venezuelan Joropo. Drawing by [[Eloy Palacios]] (1912)]]
{{main|Culture of Venezuela|Heritage of Venezuela}}

Venezuela's [[heritage]], [[art]] and cultural importance is primarily found within the collective [[cultural identity|identity]] of its people.  In a larger context, the key elements of Venezuelan society have also been shaped and impacted by the historical evolutions of its [[Latin American]] counterparts.  Venezuela's heritage may be defined in its inherited circumstances and benefits.  Venezuelan heritage extends to its historic buildings, architecture<ref>{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/658 | title=Coro and its Port | publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | year=1993}}</ref> and art<ref>{{cite web | title=Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/986 | year=2000 | publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref>, its landscape, boundaries and place within Latin America, and finally its monuments and items considered worthy of preservation.  Hence, Venezuelan heritage is naturally connected and related to its culture, as culture defines a nation's intellectual and artistic endeavors.  Through the collective customs, beliefs, practices and expressions of its people, a [[cultural identity]] is achieved.  Together, Venezuelan heritage, art and [[culture]] represent the historic and contemporary elements of its society.  

Venezuelan culture comes from a variety of heritages, mainly of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[African]] provenance, dating from the [[Colony|Colonial Period]]. Before this period, indigenous cultural manifestations were expressed in art ([[petroglyph]]s), [[craft]]s, architecture (''[[shabono]]s'') and social organization. Aboriginal culture was subsequently assimilated by [[Spaniards]]; over the years, the [[hybrid]] culture had diversified by region.
[[Image:Dia Virgen del Valle 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Worship of the Virgin of the Valley, [[Isla Margarita]]]]
[[Art of Venezuela|Venezuelan art]] is gaining attention within and outside the country. First dominated by religious motives, in the late [[19th century]] it changed to historical and heroic representations, led by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]]. Modernism took over in the [[20th century]]. Some remarkable Venezuelan artists include [[Arturo Michelena]], [[Cristóbal Rojas]], [[Armando Reverón]],  [[Manuel Cabré]], [[Jesús-Rafael Soto]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]] (who both contributed greatly to [[kinetic art]]) and [[Yucef Merhi]].

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:DiablosDanzantesYare.jpg|thumb|left|Image of a traditional public [[performance]] by the ''[[Diablos Danzantes de Yare]]'' (''Dancing Devils of Yare'')]] -->
[[Venezuelan literature]] began developing soon after the [[Spanish conquest]], and it was dominated by [[Spanish culture]] and thinking. Following the rise of political literature during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence|Independence War]], then came [[Romanticism]], the first important genre in the region, whose great exponent was [[Juan Vicente González]]. Although  mainly focused on [[narrative]], poets also figure with great importance, [[Andrés Eloy Blanco]] being the most famous of them, and also [[Fermín Toro]]. Major writers and novelists are [[Rómulo Gallegos]], [[Teresa de la Parra]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], [[Adriano González León]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]] and [[Mariano Picón Salas]]. Another great poet and humanist was [[Andrés Bello]], besides being an educator and an intellectual.

Other philosophers and intellectuals, like [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]] and [[José Gil Fortoul]], along with many other writers, sustained the theory of [[Venezuelan positivism]].

The great architect of the Venezuelan Modern era was [[Carlos Raúl Villanueva]], who designed and built the [[Central University of Venezuela|Universidad Central de Venezuela]], ([[World Heritage Site]]) and its [[Aula Magna]]. Venezuelan architectural examples are the [[Capitolio(Venezuela)|Capitol]], the [[Baralt Theatre]], the [[Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex]], and the [[General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge]].

Indigenous musical styles are sort of a crucible of Venezuelan cultural inheritances, most exemplified by groups like [[Un Solo Pueblo]] and [[Serenata Guayanesa]]. The national musical instrument is the [[cuatro]]. The typical or representative musical styles are mainly from the [[llanos]] area and its surroundings, such as ''[[Alma Llanera]]'' (by [[Pedro Elías Gutiérrez]] and [[Rafael Bolivar Coronado]]), ''[[Florentino y el Diablo]]'' (by [[Alberto Arvelo Torrealba]]), ''Concierto en la llanura'' by [[Juan Vicente Torrealba]], and ''[[Caballo Viejo]]'' (by [[Simón Díaz]]). The [[Gaita (music style)]] is also a popular style, played generally during Christmas, typical of the [[Zulia]]n region. The national dance is the ''[[joropo]]''.  [[Teresa Carreño]] was a world famous piano [[virtuoso|virtuosa]] during the late [[19th century]].

Venezuela is also known for their world famous baseball players, such as [[Luis Aparicio]], who is in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] (USA), [[Dave Concepción|David Concepción]], [[Ozzie Guillén|Oswaldo Guillén]], [[Andrés Galarraga]], [[Omar Vizquel]], [[Luis Sojo]], [[Bobby Abreu]], and [[Johan Santana]], winner of the [[Cy Young Award]] in [[2004]]. Although [[baseball]] is tremendously popular (it's the national pastime), [[football (soccer)]] is also gaining popularity, due to the increasing performance of the [[Venezuela national football team]].

*The '''National Flower''' is the [[orchid]] ''(Cattleya mossiae)''. This kind of [[orchid]] is also known as ''Flor de Mayo'' (''May Flower''). It was first discovered in the northern land in [[1839]] and was given the status of [[National emblem|National Flower]] on [[23 May]] [[1951]].

*The '''National Tree''' is the ''[[Tabebuia|araguaney]]'' ''(Tabebuia chrysantha)''. Called ''aravanei'' by the ''[[caribes]]'', it can be found mostly in regions with temperate [[weather]]. It can reach a height between 6 and 12 m. The ''[[Tabebuia|araguaney]]'' flourishes within the period following a rainy season, mostly in the first months of the year. [[Rómulo Gallegos]] referred to these months as "''La primavera de oro de los araguaneyes''" (the golden spring of the ''araguaneyes''). Declared [[National emblem|National Tree]] on [[29 May]] [[1945]].

*The '''National Bird''' is the [[turpial]] ''(Icterus icterus)''. Fully coloured with yellow-orange tones except in the head and the wings, which are black with a few tones in white; also has a blue spot surrounding the eyes. It can be found in [[woods]], the ''[[llanos]]'', at the shores of [[jungles]], and in northern and southern [[Orinoco]]. The [[turpial]] is fairly appreciated due to its singing and was declared the [[National emblem|National Bird]] on [[23 May]] [[1958]].
