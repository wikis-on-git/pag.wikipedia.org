==Say siyudad==

Since its establishment as a small fishing port and a major [[sea salt|salt-making]] center during the [[History of the Philippines#The New Spanish Colonial Period (1521&ndash;1821)|Spanish Era]], Las Piñas has grown into an important residential, commercial and industrial suburb of [[Metro Manila]].

Las Piñas is famous for its [[Las Piñas Bamboo Organ|Bamboo Organ]], located inside the St. Joseph Church of the Parish of Las Piñas, formerly known as San Jose Parish Church in the Spanish Period, as the only organ of its kind in the world.  Built in 1824 by [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], Fr. Diego Cera, created out of [[bamboo]], wood, and metal, this famous [[Organ (music)|organ]] is praised for its unique, rare, and melodious sound.

The Sarao Motors factory is also located in Las Piñas, the place where [[Jeepney]]s are assembled piece by piece in painstaking individual production. The factory remains open to buyers and curious visitors all year round.

Las Piñas has a large shopping mall named [[SM Southmall]], which has an area of 205,120 square meters and is located along Alabang–Zapote Road. The newest shopping mall development in the city is [[SM Center Las Piñas]], located few meters away from the City Hall. The first high rise building in the city is 16 story residential building Almanza Metropolis.

Las Piñas, also known as one of the cleanest cities in Metro Manila, is in the list of the "Clean and Green Hall of Fame" awarded by the Philippine Government. It is also the first local government unit in the Philippines that has been honored with the prestigious Global 500 Roll of Honour of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). These honors were in recognition of the city's outstanding achievements in the protection and improvement of the environment.

Las Piñas has recently acquired the status "Most Competitive City" in the Philippines, together with [[Davao City]], Sekano ([[Makati]]), [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Marikina]].

==Historiya==

Las Piñas was one of the earliest fishing settlements on the shores of [[Manila Bay]] and was proclaimed a town either in 1762 or 1797. Its exact date of creation cannot be ascertained because historical records vary. Cavada, a Spanish historian and Fr. Juan Medina placed it at 1762, while Buzeta recorded the date at 1797.

Besides being famous for its [[Bamboo Organ]], which was built by Fr. Diego Cera and completed in 1824, the town of Las Piñas was also a major war theater during the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]], as it was occupied by Gen. [[Emilio Aquinaldo]]'s forces. Las Piñas was also, occupied by the [[Trabaho diad Hapon diad Pilipino|Japanese]] during [[Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig|Second World War]], to be followed by the liberation period, when the combined Filipino and American forces fought the Japanese Imperial armed forces until the end of war.

In 1901, the Municipality of Las Piñas was incorporated from [[Cavite]] to the newly created province of [[Rizal]] pursuant to [[Philippines|Philippine]] Commission Act No. 137. Two years later, it was combined with [[Parañaque City|Parañaque]], the latter being the seat of a new municipal government.

It became a separate municipality from [[Parañaque City|Parañaque]] on March 27, 1907 by virtue of [[Philippines|Philippine]] Commission Act No. 1625. Then, with the founding of the [[Metro Manila|Metropolitan Manila]] Area ([[Metro Manila]] in short) in 1976, Las Piñas became one of the municipalities making up the region.

On February 12, 1997, President [[Fidel Ramos]] signed the bill declaring Las Piñas a new city. A plebiscite held a month after found the residents in approval of cityhood and Las Piñas became the 10th city of [[Metro Manila]] on March 26, 1997.
