==Historiya==
Unlike some parts of Isabela like [[Santiago City]], [[Echague, Isabela|Echague]] and [[Alicia, Isabela|Alicia]] the history of the municipality of Quezon is relatively recent. The former municipalities have long been seats of rich and colorful historical events that influenced the lives of the people of Isabela since its creation on May 1, 1856 through a Royal Decree issued in honor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]] of [[Spain]] (reigned 1843 to 1868). It was in these very places where decisions that ultimately governed the lives of the local people were made by Spanish authorities.

Prior to its creation, Quezon was once part of a vast track of agricultural land called the Mallig Plains. At that time, the area that is presently under the political jurisdiction of the municipality was sparsely populated. Historians believe that the precursor of the present inhabitants of Quezon were the [[Igorots]] and the [[Kalingas]] of the [[Cordilleras]]. Although the Igorots and the Kalingas are primarily upland dwellers, historians have observed that these natives come down from the highlands from time to time to hunt for low-landers especially the ''Kanyaw'' rituals.

When [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was elected as the [[President of the Philippines|President]] of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]], one of his administrationâ€™s main programs was to promote development in the other areas in the country aside from [[Manila]]. In order to achieve this objective, President Quezon opened up vast uninhabited areas for settlement hoping that these would be developed by those who will decide to settle in those areas. Aside from [[Mindanao]], other parts of [[Luzon]] were similarly offered for settlement and development including the province of Isabela, particularly the northwestern portion of the province which was later called Mallig Plains.

Citing for the potential of the area for settlement and agricultural development, President Quezon declared the entire land area of Mallig Plains as project site for his program on rural development. In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National Land Settlement Administration which was renamed to Land Settlement Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was basically to oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the [[Balete]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}} Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the [[Caraballo Mountains]], hundreds of inhabitants from the [[Ilocos]] and [[Central Luzon]] regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.

A few years after the declaration of the area as site for settlement and agricultural development, [[World War II]] broke out and the region was later placed under [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] control, Although the extent of damage on properties and the number of lives lost during the war was nothing compared to other areas in the Philippines, early settlers of the region had difficulty rebuilding their lives after the war for they were not spared from the wrath inflicted by the members of the Kalinga tribes from the north.

One of those who fiercely and bravely fought the onslaught of the Kalinga was Jesus Estrada for whom a barangay was named after him. It was only after the government and leaders of the tribes negotiated and agreed to end hostilities that the threat to the lives of early settlers of the region was eventually dispelled.

With the attainment of peace and security in the area, the exodus of settlers to the area increased particularly in the area of Barrio Narra where the future site of Quezon is located. But the continued influx of new settlers into the area increased the demand for basic requirements of the local residents.  Officials of Isabela, particularly Representative Delfin Albano of the [[:en:Legislative districts of Isabela|lone district of Isabela]] saw the urgency and the need to create a new municipality out of Mallig. House Bill No. 736 authored by Albano was later approved by the [[Senado diad Pilipino|Philippine Senate]] and [[saray pangulo na Filipinas|President]] [[Carlos P. Garcia]] in 1959 through [[:en:List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 2418. The name of the municipality was in honor of the last President Manuel L. Quezon who was instrumental in the development of the municipalities of [[Mallig, Isabela|Mallig]] and Quezon.

Hildebrando Pecson was appointed as the first mayor of the newly created municipality from 1960 until 1967 when after his term limit allowed by law then, he was succeeded by Hermogenes Padilla in the 1967 local elections.  In 1971 local elections, Gavino Gascon challenged Padilla and was popularly elected by people. In 1976, he was replaced by William Corpuz and was in turn unseated in 1978. Oniate Tabangcura, a former officer of the military replaced Corpuz. When [[Saray pangulo na Filipinas|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was overthrown on 1986 through the 1986 [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] issued and executive order replacing all local executives all throughout the Philippines. Corpuz was appointed as Officer-In-Charge Mayor of Quezon.  On 1988 local elections, Gavino Gascon had his seat back,again with popular votes, as mayor of Quezon. He was reelected in the 1992 and 1995 local elections. Due to term limit as stated on the 1987 [[:en:Philippine Constitution|Philippine Constitution]] and the Local Government Code of 1991, the position of mayor was left as an open race in the [[:en:Philippine general election, 1998|1998 elections]]. Lawyer Eduardo Cabantac won as municipal mayor. He was reelected in [[:en:Philippine general election, 2001|2001 local elections]] Cabantac was again reelected in the [[:en:Philippine general election, 2004|2004 local elections]] leaving the [[:en:Philippine general election, 2007|2007 local elections]] as an open race again. Gascon's son Daryl won as mayor in the said election.
