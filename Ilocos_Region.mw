'''Sagor na Baybay na Luzon Region (Northwestern Luzon Region)''' or '''Region 1'''  of the [[Philippines]] is located in the northwestern part of [[Luzon]]. It is bounded by [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] and [[Cagayan Valley]] to the east, [[Central Luzon]] to the south and by the [[South China Sea]] to the west.  

The region is composed of four [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], namely: [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[La Union]] and [[Pangasinan]]. Its regional center is [[San Fernando City, La Union|San Fernando City]], La Union. The region is occupied 70% by Ilocanos and 28% by Pangasinenses.

Although the Philippine government designated Region 1 as the Ilocos Region, many people find the designated name of the region as ethno-centric. Many people find the name '''Northwestern Region''', which is geographically deduced, as the more appropriate term.

==People and culture==
The Ilocos provinces of Region 1 is the historical homeland of the Ilocanos. The Ilocanos have the following percentage of the population inside the bracket in each province: Pangasinan (43%), La Union (92%), Ilocos Norte (97%), and Ilocos Sur (93%).  Pangasinan is the historical homeland of the [[Pangasinense|Pangasinenses]]. The population of Pangasinan composed around 60% of the whole population of the region. The Pangasinenses presently constitute around 50% of the population of the province.  The province was not originally part of the Region 1. It was only during the time of President Marcos, when Pangasinan was included in the province. Minority groups include the [[Tingguian]] and [[Isneg]] communities that inhabit the foothills of the Cordillera mountains.

The population is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] with strong adherents of [[Protestantism]] such as the [[Aglipayan]] denomination further north of the country.  There is also an undercurrent of traditional animistic beliefs especially in rural areas. The small mercantile [[China|Chinese]] and [[India]]n communities are primarily [[Buddhist]]s and [[Hindu]]s respectively

==Economy==
Although the economy in the southern portion of the region, esp. [[Pangasinan]], is anchored in agro-industial and service industry, the economy in the northern portion of the region is anchored in the agricultural sector. The economy in Pangasinan is driven by agro-industrial businesses, such as milkfish (bangus) cultivation and processing, livestock raising, fish paste processing (bagoong), and others. At the same time the importance of  trading, financial services, and educational services in the economy cannot be denied. Income in the northern portion mostly come from cultivating rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits; raising livestock such as pigs, chicken, goats, and carabaos (water buffalos). 

The distribution of the economic activity in the region may be seen from the collection of tax revenue of the national government. According to the data from the [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru1/|National Statistical Coordination Board], the bulk of the collections come from Pangasinan, which posted 61% of the total. 

The service and light manufacturing industries are concentrated in the cities. [[Dagupan City]] is mostly driven by its local entrepreneurs, which have started to expand its network up to the national level. San Fernando City in La Union also has an active shipping port and Laoag City in Ilocos Norte has a growing international airport. The government is one of the largest employers along with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola.

The tourism industry focuses on the coastal beaches and on eco-tourism. There are fine sands stretching along Bauang, La Union and the rest of the region. Opportunities to engage in other water sports and activities abound. Eco-tourism takes advantage of the marine and forest resources in the region and displays the natural beauty of the Ilocos.

The region is also rich in crafts, with renowned blanket-weaving and pottery.  Their ''burnay'' pottery is well known for its dark colored clay.

==Political Division==
Region 1 is composed of 4 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and a total of 9 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]].

===Physical===
Region 1 occupies the narrow plain between the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central]] mountain range and the [[South China Sea]]. It also occupies the northern portion of the Central Luzon plain, to the northeast of the [[Zambales Mountains]]. 

[[Lingayen Gulf]] is the most notable body of water in the region and it contains a number of islands, including the [[Hundred Islands National Park]]. To the north of the region is [[Luzon Strait]].

The [[Agno]] [[river]] runs through [[Pangasinan]] and empties into Lingayen Gulf. The river flow into a broad delta in the vicinity of [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]] and [[Dagupan City]].

==Tourist Attractions==
'''Hundred Islands National Park.''' Located in the [[Lingayen Gulf]] in [[Pangasinan]], the watery park is dotted by 123 small, pristine islands. Three islands have been developed for tourists.

'''Vigan colonial houses.''' [[Vigan City]] is famous for its cobblestone streets and Spanish-style houses, an architectural remnant of its colonial past. The Mestizo District displays mansions typical of the era. They were owned by prominent Ilocano-Chinese merchant families of that time, hence [[mestizo]] or "mixed race."

'''Ancient churches.''' The region is dotted by old Catholic churches built by natives for the Spanish. Famous churches can be found in Vigan City, once the seat of the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, and in Manaoag, Pangasinan.

==History==
Region 1 was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos before they were pushed by successive waves of Malay immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, and Pangasinense in the south settled the region.

The Spanish arrived in the 16th century and established Christian missions and governmental institutions to control the native population and convert them to the Roman Catholic church. Present-day Vigan City in Ilocos Sur province became the bishopric seat of Nueva Segovia. Proud Ilocanos in the northern parts were less easily swayed, however, and remained an area filled with deep resentments against Spain. These resentments bubbled to the surface at various points in the region's history as insurrections. According to Nick Joaquin in his book Culture and History, the Pangasinenses were the last to be stand against the Spaniards.

The most notable of the rebellions were that of [[Andres Malong]] and [[Palaris]] of Pangasinan,[[Diego Silang]] and his wife [[Gabriela Silang]] in 1764, and the Basi Revolt in the 19th century.

In 1901, the region went under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation.

Several modern presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region: [[Elpidio Quirino]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and [[Fidel Ramos]].

Before the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] was formed, Region 1 also included the provinces of [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[Mountain Province]], and [[Benguet]].
