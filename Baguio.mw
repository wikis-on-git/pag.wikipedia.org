==Historiya==
===Early history===
The region around Baguio was first settled primarily by the [[Ibaloi]]s and the [[Kankanaey]]s. In the nearby town of [[La Trinidad, Benguet]], Spaniards established a ''commandante'' or military garrison, but Kafagway, as Baguio was once known, was barely touched. 

===Koloniyal period diad Amerikano===
When the Americans took possession of the [[Philippines]], Baguio was selected by a party to become the summer capital of the Philippines.  In 1903 [[Too diad Pilipino|Filipino]], [[Too diad Hapón|Japanese]] and [[Too diad Intsik|Chinese]]  workers were hired to build [[Kalsada ya Kennon|Kennon Road]], the first road directly connecting Baguio with the lowlands of [[Pangasinan]]. Before this, the only road to [[Benguet]] was Naguilian Road. 

The Americans declared Baguio the Summer Capital of the Philippines on July 1, 1903 .  Every year during the months of March to June, the entire American government personnel from the Governor-General to the humblest clerk was moved to Baguio to escape Manila's summer heat (abolished in 1913 when [[Francis B. Harrison]] took office).  The [[The Mansion (Baguio)|Mansion House]] was built to become the residence of the American governor-general.  The famous American architect [[Daniel Burnham]], one of the earliest successful modern city planners, laid a meticulous plan for the city in 1904. On September 1, 1909 Baguio was declared a chartered city, the second after the city of Manila.  They further developed Baguio, building parks and public structures such as Wright Park in honor of Governor General [[Luke E. Wright]], [[Burnham Park (Philippines)|Burnham Park]] in honor of Baguio city planner [[Daniel Burnham]], Governor Pack Road, and [[Kalsada ya Sesiyon|Session Road]]. 

===Ikalawang Digman ed Kamondoan===
On [[April 26]], [[1945]], Filipino troops of the 1st, 2nd, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 1st Infantry Regiment of the [[:en:Philippine Constabulary|Philippine Constabulary]] and the USAFIP-NL 66th Infantry Regiment and the American troops of the 33rd and 37th Infantry Division of the United States Army entered Baguio City and fought against the [[Sundalo ya Imperiyal diad Hapón|Japanese Imperial Army]] forces led by [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|General Tomoyuki Yamashita]] which started the Battle for the Liberation of Baguio City during [[Ikalawang Digman ed Kamondoan]]. 

Baguio is the site of the formal surrender of General Tomoyuki Yamashita and Vice Admiral Okochi. It is where they gave up the entire Imperial Japanese Armed Forces to American authorities at the [[:en:John Hay Air Base#The American Residence|High Commissioner's Residence]] (now the United States Ambassador's Residence) in [[Camp John Hay]] on [[September 3]], [[1945]], marking the end of World War II.

===Earthquake nen [[1990]]===
The very strong [[1990 Luzon earthquake]] (Ms = 7.8) destroyed much of city of Baguio on July 16, 1990.<ref>http://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/update_SOEPD/Earthquake/1990LuzonEQ_Monograph/pp001/pp001.html</ref> A significant number of buildings and infrastructure were damaged, major highways were temporarily severed, and a number of houses were leveled or severely shaken with a significant loss of life. Some of the fallen buildings were built on or near fault lines. Baguio City was rebuilt with the aid from the national government and various international donors like [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and other countries.

===Zona diad heritage===
Around May 2003, a petition initiated by Dion Fernandez to declare Baguio a heritage zone was circulated on the Internet and national print media, gaining more than 10,000 signatures. The petition calls upon unspecified officials to create the Zone prior to the Baguio centennial in 2009. In May 2005, the Heritage Conservation Society(HCS) submitted to the Baguio City Council a proposed Special Heritage Bill drafted by HCS Trustee Ivan Henares. It has been approved on second reading but is being opposed by a group of businessmen{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

[[File:MansionHouseBaguio.jpg|thumb|[[The Mansion (Baguio)|The Mansion]], the official summer residence of the [[Saray pangulo na Filipinas|President of the Philippines]]]]
Like most Philippine cities, Baguio is governed by a mayor, vice mayor, and twelve (12) councilors. However, being a highly-urbanized city with its own charter, it is not subject to the jurisdiction of Benguet province, of which it was formerly a part.

The current mayor of Baguio is Mauricio Domogan, and the lone congressional district is currently represented by Congressman Bernardo Vergara, who has already served before as the Baguio's representative to congress. They were re-elected last May 2010.

[[File:Loakan Airport.JPEG|thumb|left|Say panakas ed [[Paliparan diad Loakan]]]]
'''[[Paliparan diad Loakan|Loakan Airport]]''' is  the lone airport serving the general area of Baguio. The airport is classified as a trunkline airport, or a major commercial domestic airport, by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation and Communications that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. It is about 10 minutes by car from the city center going south. Due to the limited length of the runway which is 1,802 meters or 5,912 feet, it is restricted to commuter size aircraft. This perhaps contributed to the city's declining competitiveness against other medium-sized cities around the country. The airport is used primarily by helicopters, turbo-prop and piston engine aircraft, although on rare occasion light business jets (LBJ) have flown into the airport.

===Say lupa===
The three main access roads leading to Baguio from the lowlands are [[Kennon Road]], Aspiras-Palispis Highway (previously known as Marcos Highway)<ref>http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2000/ra_8971_2000.html</ref> and Naguilian Road, also known as Quirino Highway. Kennon Road starts at [[Rosario, La Union]] and winds upwards through a narrow, steep valley. This is often the fastest route to Baguio but it is particularly perilous, with landslides during the rainy season and sharp dropoffs, some without guardrails. The Aspiras Highway, which starts in [[Agoo, La Union]] and connects to Palispis Highway, at the boundary of Benguet and La Union Provinces, and Naguilian Road, which starts in [[Bauang, La Union]], are both longer routes but are much safer than Kennon Road especially during rainy season, and are the preferred routes for coaches, buses, lorries (trucks) and by more conservative car drivers.
[[File:Mines View Park.jpg|thumb|left|Mines View Park]]
It takes about six hours to travel the approximately 250&nbsp;km distance between [[Manila]] and Baguio City by way of [[Kennon Road]]. It is about fifteen to thirty minutes longer through the Aspiras-Palispis Highway, and could take three more hours if going up from Manila via Naguilian Road—which is the usual route for travelers from the Northern areas of Luzon such as Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and northern La Union province.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There is another access to Baguio from [[Aritao]] in the province of [[Nueva Vizcaya]] passing through [[Itogon, Benguet]] but this is less traveled, the road is not well maintained, and public transportation through this route is not as regular. It is particularly difficult during rainy periods. Another road, Halsema Highway (also known as "Mountain Trail") leads North through the mountainous portion of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera Autonomous Region]]. It starts at the northern border of Baguio City, in the Municipality of La Trinidad (Trinidad Valley). This highway offers some extraordinary scenery, coupled with some sheer drops of hundreds of feet in some sparsely populated areas. Drivers should be well-versed in Cordillera-style mountainous driving, as this road has, on very rare occasions, experienced sleet / freezing rain conditions as one proceeds North toward [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]], Mountain Province.

There are several bus lines linking Baguio with [[Manila]] and Central Luzon, and provinces such as [[Pangasinan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Quezon]], [[Bicol Region]], [[Eastern Visayas]], [[La Union]], and those in the Ilocos regions. Most transportation companies also offer express and air-conditioned buses at a higher fare, although some "aircon" minibuses offer cheaper fares. Bus services that operate in Baguio include ''', [[Victory Liner]], [[Partas]], [[GV Florida Transport]], [[Philippine Rabbit]], [[Viron Transit]], [[Dangwa Tranco]], [[Genesis Transport]], [[Saulog Transit Inc.]], [[Dagupan Bus Co.,Inc.]].''', Amianan bus line, and many smaller feeder minibuses.

There are also hundreds of '''[[Taxicab|Taxi]] and [[jitney]]''' operators who provide public transportation in Baguio City.For example,coming from [[Agoo, La Union]], [[San Fernando, La Union]] and [[Rosario, La Union]].
