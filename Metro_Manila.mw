Metro Manila is the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the country, and it is one of [[Largest cities of the world|the largest metropolitan areas in the world]]. Metro Manila is often simply referred to as ''Manila'', especially by non-residents, and is abbreviated as ''M.M.''. The region is also sometimes called the ''Greater Manila Area'', but this term usually also includes adjacent towns not strictly a part of Metro Manila.

Metro Manila is the smallest of the country's [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]], but the most populous and the most densely populated, having a population of 9,932,560 (2000 [[census]]) in an area only 636 square kilometers large. It is also the only region without any [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]. The region is bordered by the provinces of [[Bulacan]] to the north, [[Rizal]] to the east, and [[Cavite]] and [[Laguna]] to the south. Metro Manila is also sandwiched by the [[Manila Bay]] to the west and the [[Laguna de Bay]] to the southeast with the [[Pasig River]] running between them, bisecting the region.

Unlike other regions which are divided into [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR) is divided into four districts. These districts were created in 1976 but have no local government and no congressional representation (unlike the districts in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]). They are used mostly for fiscal and statistical purposes. The cities and municipalities within the NCR are grouped into the four districts as follows:

'''First District''': [[Manila]]

'''Second District''': [[Mandaluyong City]], [[Marikina City]], [[Pasig City]], [[Quezon City]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]

'''Third District''': [[Caloocan City]], [[Malabon City]], [[Navotas, Metro Manila|Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela City]].

'''Fourth District''': [[Las Pi&ntilde;as City]], [[Makati City]], [[Muntinlupa City]], [[Para&ntilde;aque City]], [[Pasay City]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Taguig City]]

The term ''Metro Manila'' should not be confused with the [[metro]] rail system of the region, and the word ''metro'' itself always describes the metropolitan area (as in ''the metro''). The railways are called by their abbreviations, such as the LRT and the MRT.
