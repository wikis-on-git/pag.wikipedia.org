==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 10.55% of the MediaWiki messages and 0.78% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised.

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

== Localized logo ==
Hello!

The Wikimedia Foundation recently <span class="plainlinks">[http://blog.wikimedia.org/2010/wikipedia-in-3d/ updated]</span> the official Wikipedia globe.  We realize that a lot of projects have never had a localized logo in their native language, so we are making sure that we create logos for every Wikipedia project that we have.  The only issue is:  we can't figure out what should be on your localized logo. <kbd>:-)</kbd>

Could you please provide a translation for the following?
* Wikipedia
* The Free Encyclopedia 

Please put the translation on my [[m:User talk:Cbrown1023|Meta talk page]].  Thank you! '''[[User:Cbrown1023|<span style="color:green">Cbrown1023</span>]]''' '''<small>[[User talk:Cbrown1023|<span style="color:#002bb8">tongtongan</span>]]</small>''' 00:54, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

==Language support group for Pangasinan==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net. <br>
Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 18:40, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

===The Babel extension===
When people want to indicate their proficiency in a language, they use the Babel extension. Sadly this localisation has not been done yet. Could someone be so kind and help us by [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-babel&language=pag localising the Babel extension]. Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 18:40, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

==Wikidata is now open==
'''Greetings!'''
 
First I apologize for not posting this with your language. Just a reminder that <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org Wikidata]</span> is now open. Check it out and see how <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Contribute you can contribute]</span>, set up pages for your language, and join the <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat discussions]</span> that could eventually affect this wiki.

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review ==
Hello. A new policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was recently adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] (your community received a notice about the discussion). According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on smaller wikis. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the new [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]] here.

We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#Arikasikis (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki.

[[File:Major_Philippine_languages.png|thumb|250px| <!--T:3--> Major Philippine ethnolinguistic groups]]

Hello '''''Everyone''''',

'''[[:meta:Wikipedia Philippine Month|Wikipedia Philippine Month]]''' or simply '''Wikipedia PH Month''' is a monthly editing activity inspired by [[:meta:Wikipedia Asian Month|Wikipedia Asian Month]]. It aims to bridge knowledge gaps on Philippine content in Philippine language editions of Wikipedia and beyond. The participating community is not limited to the Philippines and is open to all Wikipedia editions! This activity also aims to encourage collaboration among Filipino contributors within the archipelago and in the diaspora, and create linkages among Filipino and non-Filipino contributors who support the main objective.

=== How to Participate in the Activity === 
'''As an Editor''' 
* Find the language edition of Wikipedia you would like to build on.
* Register an account if you have not done so.
* Choose articles about the Topic of the Month, but NOT from YOUR NATIVE LOCALITY, and start creating or improving articles.
* Write in the summary box the hashtag '''''#WikiPHmonth''''' before saving your work.

'''As an Organizer'''
* Set up and run the contest on a local level within your language community. (e.g. [[:bcl:Wikipedia:Wikipedia Philippine Month 2021]])
* If your local Wikipedia is already participating, ask if you can help judge articles if you are interested.
* Engage local editors and aim for maximum participation.
* Organize online and offline events for contest promotion and increase in participation.
* If you have expertise or skills in [[:en:public relations|public relations]], then you can help us get media coverage.

=== Topics ===
[[File:TribalPhilippinesTraditionalRange.png|thumb| <!--T:4--> Traditional homelands of the '''[[:en:indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous peoples of the Philippines]]'''|alt=|250px]]
Each participating local Wikipedia community runs a monthly online edit-a-thon, which promotes the creation or improvement of the Wikipedia content about a particular group or [[:en:Ethnic groups in the Philippines|groups of people in the Philippines]] and the region they represent. 

* '''JANUARY''' - The '''[[:en:Visayans|Visayans]]''' (Region VI, Region VII, Region VIII, Romblon) are a metaethnicity race native to the whole [[:en:Visayas|Visayas]], to the southernmost islands of Luzon (MIMAROPA Region and Masbate) and the northern and eastern coastal parts of Mindanao. They are speakers of one or more Visayan languages, the most widely spoken being ''Cebuano, Hiligaynon'' and ''Waray-Waray''. They comprise the largest ethnic group in the nation. 
* '''February''' - Wiki Loves Love; Chinese New Year - [[:en:Chinese Filipino|Filipino-Chinese heritage]]  
* '''March''' - WikiGap; Women's Month - [[:en:Filipina|Filipina]]
* '''APRIL''' - The '''[[:en:Tagalogs|Tagalogs]]''' (NCR, Region IV-A, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Marinduque) are the most widespread ethnic group in the Philippines. They predominate the entirety of the [[:en:Manila|Manila]] and mainland [[:en:CALABARZON|southern Luzon regions]], with a plurality in [[:en:Central Luzon|Central Luzon]] (mainly in its southeastern portion, as well as parts of Zambales and Bataan provinces except for Pampanga and Tarlac) and coastal parts of Mindoro. The Tagalog language was chosen as an official language of the Philippines in 1935. Today, Filipino, a de facto version of Tagalog, is taught throughout the archipelago. 
* '''MAY''' - Heritage Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Cordilleras), '''Mangyan''' (in central Mindoro island), '''Suludnon''' (in central Panay island, and '''Negritos''' (in remote areas throughout Luzon, Panay, Negros islands, and Mindanao). The ''[[:en:Igorot|Igorots/Cordillerans]]'' live in the highlands of Luzon. They are primarily located in the [[:en:Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera Administrative Region]], Caraballo Mountains, and Sierra Madre. ''[[:en:Mangyan|Mangyan]]'' is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found on the island of Mindoro, southwest of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, each with its own tribal name, language, and customs. They occupy nearly the whole of the interior of the island of Mindoro. The ''[[:en:Negrito|Negrito]]'' are several Australo-Melanesian groups who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia. They all live in remote areas throughout the islands in the Philippines. The ''[[:en:Suludnon|Suludnon]]'', also known as the Tumandok, Sulod, Panay-Bukidnon, or Panayanon Sulud, are an indigenous Visayan group of people who reside in the Capiz-Lambunao mountainous area and the Antique-Iloilo mountain area of central Panay in the Visayan islands of the Philippines.
* '''June''' - Filipino-Spanish Friendship Day - [[:en:Spanish Filipino|Filipino-Spanish heritage]] 
* '''JULY''' - The '''[[:en:Ilocano people|Ilocanos]]''' and minorities in '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' in [[:en:Cagayan Valley Region|Cagayan Valley Region]] (Region I, Region II) are predominantly Christian group who reside within the lowlands and coastal areas of [[:en:Ilocos Region|northwestern Luzon]]. Other Ilocanos are also found in Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley. The ''Ivatan'' (also spelled as Ibatan) are the predominant ethnolinguistic group in the [[:en:Batanes|Batanes]] islands of the Philippines. They have close cultural links with the Taiwanese aborigines, especially the Yami/Tao people of Orchid Island under jurisdiction of Taiwan. The ''Ibanags'' are a predominantly Christian lowland ethnic group numbering around half a million people and who primarily inhabit the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon. The ''Itawes''/Itawis/Itawit are among the earliest inhabitants of the [[:en:Cagayan Valley|Cagayan Valley]] in northern Luzon. The ''Gaddang'' number about 25,000. They are known to have inhabited the upper Cagayan Valley and the Magat valley below Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya and in [[:en:Isabela|Isabela]] since before the Spanish arrived. 
* '''AUGUST''' - Indigenous Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Tribal Palaweño, and Lumad) and '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' ([[:en:Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro]]). The ''[[:en:peoples of Palawan|peoples and tribes of Palawan]]'' are a diverse group of both indigenous tribes and lowland groups that historically migrated to the island of Palawan and its outlying islands. The ''[[:en:Lumad|Lumad]]'' are the un-Islamized and un-Christianized indigenous Austronesian peoples of Mindanao. They include several ethnolinguistic nations such as the Manobo, the Tasaday, the Mamanwa, the Mandaya, the B'laan, the T'boli, and the Kalagan. They primarily inhabit the eastern parts of Mindanao such as the Caraga, and Davao Regions. The collective term ''[[:en:Moro people|Moro]]'' or Bangsamoro people refers to the, at least 13, islamicized ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan. The Muslim Moros originally had a few independent states such as the Maguindanao Sultanate, the Lanao Sultanates, and the Sulu Sultanate. The Sultanate of Sulu once exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of Basilan, Palawan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and North Kalimantan in Indonesia.
*'''SEPTEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Bicolano people|Bikolanos]]''' and '''[[:en:Masbateño people|Masbateños]]''' (Region V) are a predominantly Roman Catholic ethnic group that originates from the Bicol Region in Southern Luzon. They are the fifth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines. ''Masbateños'' live in Masbate province of the Philippines. Masbateños may be considered Visayans by language but are Bicolanos by region.
* '''OCTOBER''' - The '''[[:en:Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]''' and '''[[:en:Bolinao language|Bolinaos]]''' (Pangasinan) are the eighth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines. They predominate in the northwestern portion of Central Luzon (entire Pangasinan, northern Tarlac, northwestern Nueva Ecija and northern Zambales), as well as southwestern parts of La Union and Benguet. The ''Bolinao'' people live in Bolinao and Anda, Pangasinan. They speak the Bolinao language or Binubolinao, which is the second most widely spoken Sambalic language in Pangasinan (after Sambal).
* '''November''' - Wikipedia Asian Month - [[:en:Asian people|Asian Heritage]] 
* '''DECEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]]''' and '''[[:en:Sambal people|Sambals]]''' (Pampanga, Zambales, Tarlac) are the seventh-largest ethnic group in the Philippines. They primarily use the Kapampangan language, which is spoken by more than 1.4 million individuals. The ''Sambals'' are the inhabitants of the province of Zambales, including the independent city of Olongapo. They are also found in the municipalities of Bolinao and Anda in northwestern Pangasinan. Sambals currently make up a large proportion of the population in the Zambales municipalities of north of Iba, the provincial capital. Their language, Sambal, is related to Kapampangan.
