Say '''Urdaneta City''' ([[salitan Pangasinan]]: '''Siyudad na Urdaneta''') [[siyudad]] ed [[luyag]] na [[luyag na Pangasinan|Pangasinan]], [[Filipinas]]. Onong ed [[2000]] census, walay population to ya 111,582 ya too diad 22,908 ya pamilya. The city has been identified by the Province of Pangasinan as a growth pole, thereby making the sorrounding localities as its satellite.


== Geography ==


The City of Urdaneta is located in eastern part of the Province of Pangasinan, situated on 15°56' to 16°0' latitude and 120°29' to 120°37' longitude.

Traverse by the [[Manila North Road]] virtually bisecting the locality into the west and east side. The city is bounded north by the Municipalities of Binalonan, Laoac and Manaoag, south by villasis, east by Asingan and west by Sta. Barbara and Malasiqui.

The city is approximately 186 km. from [[Metro Manila]], 70 km. from [[Baguio]], and 40 km. from [[Lingayen]].

== Historical Background ==


Other localities have legends of their own as to how their names evolved. Urdaneta differs.

The Purists maintain that since the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] root word was organo, the correct name should have been "Organists". On the other hand, the Theorists are of the opinion that the original name of the city was "Organeta" meaning "little organ or unit" considering that at that time, the place was composed of portions of barrios of adjacent towns where travelers and traders  converged.

But the next issue that biweldered the concerned groups was whether the city was named after Fr. Andres Urdaneta or Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. While the archives of the National Library show that it was after Fr. Miguel de Urdaneta, some articles on the city's history envariably reffered to Fr. Simon de Urdaneta. Curiously noted historian Fr. Jose Ma. Gonzalez, author of "Labor Evangelica y Civilizadora delos Religioso en Pangasinan", was silent in this issue. 



== Creation of the City ==


On January 10, 1998, the Philippine Congress enacted and passed R.A. 8480 converting the Municipality of Urdaneta as a component city of the Province of Pangasinan. The electorate in a plebiscite overhelmingly ratified this legislative act and the locality was proclaimed as a city on March 21, 1998.

== Establishments ==

Most commercial establishments in Urdaneta such as large department and variety stores, business and professional offices, hotels and theaters are found in brgy's Poblacion, Nancayasan and San Vicente. There are also food chains such as [[Jollibee]], [[McDonald's]], Cindys, [[Shakeys]], [[Chowking]] and [[KFC]]. And offices of multinational companies, among which are those of Coca-Cola Phils., Pepsi-Cola, San Miguel Corp. and Nestle products. There are also malls in the city such as Magic Mall and CB Balingit Mall. [[SM Prime Holdings]] also wants also to put up a mall in the city. The city also hosts the Sanctuary I.T. Building Pangasinan's first Philippine Ecozone Authroity (PEZA) building in Barangay Nancayasan.

== Urdaneta tops in finances ==


[[Urdaneta City]] is now the cream of the crop. Based on the financial report released by the Commission on Audit for 2005, Urdaneta City is now the leading city not only in [[Pangasinan]] but in the Northwestern Luzon region in terms of net income, gross income, total assets and total equity.
The COA report showed  Urdaneta reported a net income of P132,107,000  with a gross income of  P382,699,000 and expenses amounting to  P250,582,000, considered only as the third highest among eight cities in the region. Urdaneta, which won its cityhood only in March 1998, had the highest  total assets among all  the region’s cities totaling P810,722,000, registering total equity of  P693,166,000 with total liabilities of P117,546,000, among the lowest in the region so far.

In contrast, [[Dagupan City]] the oldest city in Region 1 had the lowest net income among in the province and among eight Northwestern Luzon Region cities at P18,901,000, according  to the COA financial  report.
Dagupan, however, registered the second highest total income at P357,404,000 but the report showed it is also the biggest spender among all eight cities, registering total expenditure amounting to P338,503,000 in 2005.

Urdaneta and Dagupan City are the only second class cities in the Northwestern Luzon region today. But Urdaneta’s rise to second class from fourth class when it earned its city hood eight years ago is considered phenomenal.

Dagupan trails Urdaneta in total assets at P713,760,000 but again it registered the highest total liabilities among all cities in the region at P372,420,000, placing its total equity to P341,340,000.
