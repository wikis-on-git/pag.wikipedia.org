==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==Translatewiki.net update==
*Currently 10.55% of the MediaWiki messages and 0.78% of the messages of the extensions used by the Wikimedia Foundation projects have been localised. Please help us help your language by localising and proof reading at [[betawiki:Special:LanguageStats/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}|translatewiki.net]].

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

== Localized logo ==
Hello!

The Wikimedia Foundation recently <span class="plainlinks">[http://blog.wikimedia.org/2010/wikipedia-in-3d/ updated]</span> the official Wikipedia globe.  We realize that a lot of projects have never had a localized logo in their native language, so we are making sure that we create logos for every Wikipedia project that we have.  The only issue is:  we can't figure out what should be on your localized logo. <kbd>:-)</kbd>

Could you please provide a translation for the following?
* Wikipedia
* The Free Encyclopedia 

Please put the translation on my [[m:User talk:Cbrown1023|Meta talk page]].  Thank you! '''[[User:Cbrown1023|<span style="color:green">Cbrown1023</span>]]''' '''<small>[[User talk:Cbrown1023|<span style="color:#002bb8">tongtongan</span>]]</small>''' 00:54, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

==Language support group for Pangasinan==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net. <br>
Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 18:40, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

===The Babel extension===
When people want to indicate their proficiency in a language, they use the Babel extension. Sadly this localisation has not been done yet. Could someone be so kind and help us by [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-babel&language=pag localising the Babel extension]. Thanks, [[User:Gmeijssen|Gmeijssen]] 18:40, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

==Wikidata is now open==
'''Greetings!'''
 
First I apologize for not posting this with your language. Just a reminder that <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org Wikidata]</span> is now open. Check it out and see how <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Contribute you can contribute]</span>, set up pages for your language, and join the <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat discussions]</span> that could eventually affect this wiki.

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review ==
Hello. A new policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was recently adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] (your community received a notice about the discussion). According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on smaller wikis. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the new [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]] here.

We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#Arikasikis (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki.

[[File:Major_Philippine_languages.png|thumb|250px| <!--T:3--> Major Philippine ethnolinguistic groups]]

Hello '''''Everyone''''',

'''[[:meta:Wikipedia Philippine Month|Wikipedia Philippine Month]]''' or simply '''Wikipedia PH Month''' is a monthly editing activity inspired by [[:meta:Wikipedia Asian Month|Wikipedia Asian Month]]. It aims to bridge knowledge gaps on Philippine content in Philippine language editions of Wikipedia and beyond. The participating community is not limited to the Philippines and is open to all Wikipedia editions! This activity also aims to encourage collaboration among Filipino contributors within the archipelago and in the diaspora, and create linkages among Filipino and non-Filipino contributors who support the main objective.

=== How to Participate in the Activity === 
'''As an Editor''' 
* Find the language edition of Wikipedia you would like to build on.
* Register an account if you have not done so.
* Choose articles about the Topic of the Month, but NOT from YOUR NATIVE LOCALITY, and start creating or improving articles.
* Write in the summary box the hashtag '''''#WikiPHmonth''''' before saving your work.

'''As an Organizer'''
* Set up and run the contest on a local level within your language community. (e.g. [[:bcl:Wikipedia:Wikipedia Philippine Month 2021]])
* If your local Wikipedia is already participating, ask if you can help judge articles if you are interested.
* Engage local editors and aim for maximum participation.
* Organize online and offline events for contest promotion and increase in participation.
* If you have expertise or skills in [[:en:public relations|public relations]], then you can help us get media coverage.

=== Topics ===
[[File:TribalPhilippinesTraditionalRange.png|thumb| <!--T:4--> Traditional homelands of the '''[[:en:indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous peoples of the Philippines]]'''|alt=|250px]]
Each participating local Wikipedia community runs a monthly online edit-a-thon, which promotes the creation or improvement of the Wikipedia content about a particular group or [[:en:Ethnic groups in the Philippines|groups of people in the Philippines]] and the region they represent. 

* '''JANUARY''' - The '''[[:en:Visayans|Visayans]]''' (Region VI, Region VII, Region VIII, Romblon) are a metaethnicity race native to the whole [[:en:Visayas|Visayas]], to the southernmost islands of Luzon (MIMAROPA Region and Masbate) and the northern and eastern coastal parts of Mindanao. They are speakers of one or more Visayan languages, the most widely spoken being ''Cebuano, Hiligaynon'' and ''Waray-Waray''. They comprise the largest ethnic group in the nation. 
* '''February''' - Wiki Loves Love; Chinese New Year - [[:en:Chinese Filipino|Filipino-Chinese heritage]]  
* '''March''' - WikiGap; Women's Month - [[:en:Filipina|Filipina]]
* '''APRIL''' - The '''[[:en:Tagalogs|Tagalogs]]''' (NCR, Region IV-A, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Marinduque) are the most widespread ethnic group in the Philippines. They predominate the entirety of the [[:en:Manila|Manila]] and mainland [[:en:CALABARZON|southern Luzon regions]], with a plurality in [[:en:Central Luzon|Central Luzon]] (mainly in its southeastern portion, as well as parts of Zambales and Bataan provinces except for Pampanga and Tarlac) and coastal parts of Mindoro. The Tagalog language was chosen as an official language of the Philippines in 1935. Today, Filipino, a de facto version of Tagalog, is taught throughout the archipelago. 
* '''MAY''' - Heritage Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Cordilleras), '''Mangyan''' (in central Mindoro island), '''Suludnon''' (in central Panay island, and '''Negritos''' (in remote areas throughout Luzon, Panay, Negros islands, and Mindanao). The ''[[:en:Igorot|Igorots/Cordillerans]]'' live in the highlands of Luzon. They are primarily located in the [[:en:Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera Administrative Region]], Caraballo Mountains, and Sierra Madre. ''[[:en:Mangyan|Mangyan]]'' is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found on the island of Mindoro, southwest of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, each with its own tribal name, language, and customs. They occupy nearly the whole of the interior of the island of Mindoro. The ''[[:en:Negrito|Negrito]]'' are several Australo-Melanesian groups who inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia. They all live in remote areas throughout the islands in the Philippines. The ''[[:en:Suludnon|Suludnon]]'', also known as the Tumandok, Sulod, Panay-Bukidnon, or Panayanon Sulud, are an indigenous Visayan group of people who reside in the Capiz-Lambunao mountainous area and the Antique-Iloilo mountain area of central Panay in the Visayan islands of the Philippines.
* '''June''' - Filipino-Spanish Friendship Day - [[:en:Spanish Filipino|Filipino-Spanish heritage]] 
* '''JULY''' - The '''[[:en:Ilocano people|Ilocanos]]''' and minorities in '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' in [[:en:Cagayan Valley Region|Cagayan Valley Region]] (Region I, Region II) are predominantly Christian group who reside within the lowlands and coastal areas of [[:en:Ilocos Region|northwestern Luzon]]. Other Ilocanos are also found in Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley. The ''Ivatan'' (also spelled as Ibatan) are the predominant ethnolinguistic group in the [[:en:Batanes|Batanes]] islands of the Philippines. They have close cultural links with the Taiwanese aborigines, especially the Yami/Tao people of Orchid Island under jurisdiction of Taiwan. The ''Ibanags'' are a predominantly Christian lowland ethnic group numbering around half a million people and who primarily inhabit the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon. The ''Itawes''/Itawis/Itawit are among the earliest inhabitants of the [[:en:Cagayan Valley|Cagayan Valley]] in northern Luzon. The ''Gaddang'' number about 25,000. They are known to have inhabited the upper Cagayan Valley and the Magat valley below Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya and in [[:en:Isabela|Isabela]] since before the Spanish arrived. 
* '''AUGUST''' - Indigenous Month - '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Highland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Highland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' (Tribal Palaweño, and Lumad) and '''[[:en:Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines#Lowland_Ethnolinguistic_Nations|Lowland Ethnolinguistic Nations]]''' ([[:en:Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro]]). The ''[[:en:peoples of Palawan|peoples and tribes of Palawan]]'' are a diverse group of both indigenous tribes and lowland groups that historically migrated to the island of Palawan and its outlying islands. The ''[[:en:Lumad|Lumad]]'' are the un-Islamized and un-Christianized indigenous Austronesian peoples of Mindanao. They include several ethnolinguistic nations such as the Manobo, the Tasaday, the Mamanwa, the Mandaya, the B'laan, the T'boli, and the Kalagan. They primarily inhabit the eastern parts of Mindanao such as the Caraga, and Davao Regions. The collective term ''[[:en:Moro people|Moro]]'' or Bangsamoro people refers to the, at least 13, islamicized ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan. The Muslim Moros originally had a few independent states such as the Maguindanao Sultanate, the Lanao Sultanates, and the Sulu Sultanate. The Sultanate of Sulu once exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of Basilan, Palawan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and North Kalimantan in Indonesia.
*'''SEPTEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Bicolano people|Bikolanos]]''' and '''[[:en:Masbateño people|Masbateños]]''' (Region V) are a predominantly Roman Catholic ethnic group that originates from the Bicol Region in Southern Luzon. They are the fifth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines. ''Masbateños'' live in Masbate province of the Philippines. Masbateños may be considered Visayans by language but are Bicolanos by region.
* '''OCTOBER''' - The '''[[:en:Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]''' and '''[[:en:Bolinao language|Bolinaos]]''' (Pangasinan) are the eighth-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines. They predominate in the northwestern portion of Central Luzon (entire Pangasinan, northern Tarlac, northwestern Nueva Ecija and northern Zambales), as well as southwestern parts of La Union and Benguet. The ''Bolinao'' people live in Bolinao and Anda, Pangasinan. They speak the Bolinao language or Binubolinao, which is the second most widely spoken Sambalic language in Pangasinan (after Sambal).
* '''November''' - Wikipedia Asian Month - [[:en:Asian people|Asian Heritage]] 
* '''DECEMBER''' - The '''[[:en:Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]]''' and '''[[:en:Sambal people|Sambals]]''' (Pampanga, Zambales, Tarlac) are the seventh-largest ethnic group in the Philippines. They primarily use the Kapampangan language, which is spoken by more than 1.4 million individuals. The ''Sambals'' are the inhabitants of the province of Zambales, including the independent city of Olongapo. They are also found in the municipalities of Bolinao and Anda in northwestern Pangasinan. Sambals currently make up a large proportion of the population in the Zambales municipalities of north of Iba, the provincial capital. Their language, Sambal, is related to Kapampangan.

== Delay of the 2021 WMF Board of Trustees election ==

Dear Wikimedians,

We are reaching out to you today regarding the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2021|2021 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election]]. This election was due to open on August 4th. Due to some technical issues with SecurePoll, the election must be delayed by two weeks. This means we plan to launch the election on August 18th, which is the day after Wikimania concludes.

For information on the technical issues, you can see the [[phab:T287859|Phabricator ticket]].

We are truly sorry for this delay and hope that we will get back on schedule on August 18th. We are in touch with the Elections Committee and the candidates to coordinate next steps. We will update the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2021|Board election Talk page]] and [https://t.me/wmboardgovernancechat Telegram channel] as we know more.

These guidelines are not final but you can help move the progress forward. Provide comments about these guidelines by 17 October 2021. The committee will be revising the guidelines based upon community input.

Everyone may share comments in a number of places. Facilitators welcome comments in any language on the [[m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement draft guidelines review|draft review talk page]] or by email. Comments can also be shared on talk pages of translations, at local discussions, or during round-table discussions and conversation hours.

There are planned live discussions about the UCoC enforcement draft guidelines:

== Movement Charter Drafting Committee - Community Elections to take place October 11 - 24 ==

This is a short message with an update from the Movement Charter process. The call for candidates for the Drafting Committee closed September 14, and we got a diverse range of candidates. The committee will consist of 15 members, and those will be (s)elected via three different ways.

The 15 member committee will be selected with a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Charter/Drafting Committee/Set Up Process|3-step process]]:
* Election process for project communities to elect 7 members of the committee. 
* Selection process for affiliates to select 6 members of the committee. 
* Wikimedia Foundation process to appoint 2 members of the committee. 

The community elections will take place between October 11 and October 24. The other process will take place in parallel, so that all processes will be concluded by November 1. 

For the full context of the Movement Charter, its role, as well the process for its creation, please [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Charter|have a look at Meta]]. You can also contact us at any time on Telegram or via email (wikimedia2030@wikimedia.org).

The Board of Trustees is preparing a call for feedback about the upcoming Board Elections, from January 7 - February 10, 2022.

While details will be finalized the week before the call, we have confirmed at least two questions that will be asked during this call for feedback:

* What is the best way to ensure fair representation of emerging communities among the Board?

* What involvement should candidates have during the election?

While additional questions may be added, the Movement Strategy and Governance team wants to provide time for community members and affiliates to consider and prepare ideas on the confirmed questions before the call opens. We apologize for not having a complete list of questions at this time. The list of questions should only grow by one or two questions. The intention is to not overwhelm the community with requests, but provide notice and welcome feedback on these important questions.

'''Do you want to help organize local conversation during this Call?'''

Contact the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Strategy and Governance|Movement Strategy and Governance team]] on Meta, on [https://t.me/wmboardgovernancechat Telegram], or via email at msg[[File:At sign.svg|16x16px|link=|(_AT_)]]wikimedia.org.

Reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The Movement Strategy and Governance team will be minimally staffed until January 3. Please excuse any delayed response during this time. We also recognize some community members and affiliates are offline during the December holidays. We apologize if our message has reached you while you are on holiday.

The '''Call for Feedback: Board of Trustees elections''' is now open and will close on '''7 February 2022'''. 

With this Call for Feedback, the Movement Strategy and Governance team is taking a different approach. This approach incorporates community feedback from 2021. Instead of leading with proposals, the Call is framed around key questions from the Board of Trustees. The key questions came from the feedback about the 2021 Board of Trustees election. The intention is to inspire collective conversation and collaborative proposal development about these key questions.

There are two confirmed questions that will be asked during this Call for Feedback:

# What is the best way to ensure more diverse representation among elected candidates?  ''The Board of Trustees noted the importance of selecting candidates who represent the full diversity of the Wikimedia movement. The current processes have favored volunteers from North America and Europe.''
# What are the expectations for the candidates during the election?  ''Board candidates have traditionally completed applications and answered community questions. How can an election provide appropriate insight into candidates while also appreciating candidates’ status as volunteers?''

There is one additional question that may be presented during the Call about selection processes. This question is still under discussion, but the Board wanted to give insight into the confirmed questions as soon as possible. Hopefully if an additional question is going to be asked, it will be ready during the first week of the Call for Feedback.

== Additional question to the Call for Feedback about the Board of Trustees elections ==

Dear ESEAP project communities,

I am reaching out to you today about an additional question to the Call for Feedback about Board of Trustees elections that I posted above. The Board has approved an additional question which we seek feedback to: 

'''How should affiliates participate in the elections?''' Affiliates are an important part of the Wikimedia movement. Two seats of the Board of Trustees due to be filled this year were filled in 2019 through the Affiliate-selected Board seats process. [https://foundation.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bylaws&type=revision&diff=123603&oldid=123339 A change in the Bylaws removed the distinction between community and affiliate seats]. This leaves the important question: How should affiliates be involved in the selection of new seats? 

The Board of Trustees is seeking feedback about this last question especially, although not solely, from the affiliate community. Everyone is invited to share proposals and join the conversation in the Call for Feedback channels. In addition to collecting online feedback, the Movement Strategy and Governance team will organize several video calls with affiliate members to collect feedback. These calls will be at different times and include Trustees.

On behalf of the Movement Strategy and Governance team,
