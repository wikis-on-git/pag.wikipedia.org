'''Argentina''' is a country in southern [[South America]].  It ranks second in land area in [[South America]], and [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|eighth]] in the world. 

Argentina occupies a continental surface area of 2,791,810 [[square kilometre|km²]] (1,078,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south.  It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south.  The country claims the [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. Under the name of [[Argentine Antarctica]], it claims 969,464 km² (374,312&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of [[Antarctica]], overlapping other claims made by [[Chile]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The country is formally called the '''Argentine Republic''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''República Argentina''', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[reˈpuβlika aɾxenˈtina]}}). For many legal purposes, ''Nación Argentina'' (Argentine Nation) is used.



==History==
[[Image:Toortse Rio de la Plata.png|thumb|left|200px|Río de la Plata aboriginals, as pictured by Hendrick Ottsen (1603)]]
{{main|History of Argentina}}
The first signs of human presence in Argentina are located in the [[Patagonia]] ( [[Piedra Museo]], Santa Cruz), and date from 11,000 BC.<ref>[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedra_Museo Piedra Museo]</ref>  Around 1 AD, several corn-based civilizations developed in the western [[Andean]] region (Santa María, Huarpes, Diaguitas, Sanavirones, among others). In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]], under the rule of emperor Pachacutec, launched an offensive and conquered present-day northwestern Argentina, integrating it into a region called [[Collasuyu]]. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaraní]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]]. The central and southern areas ([[Pampas]] and Patagonia) were dominated by nomadic cultures, unified in the 17th century by the [[Mapuche]]s. 

[[Image:Buenos Aires shortly after its foundation 1536.png|thumb|left|210px|Buenos Aires in 1536]]
Europeans arrived in [[1502]]. [[Spain]] established a permanent colony on the site of [[Buenos Aires]] in 1580; the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] was created in 1776. In 1806 and 1807 the [[British Empire]] [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|launched two invasions]] to Buenos Aires, but the creole population repelled both attempts. On [[May 25]], [[1810]], after confirmation of the rumors about the overthrow of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] by Napoleon, citizens of [[Buenos Aires]] took advantage of the situation and created the [[Primera Junta|First Government Junta]] ([[May Revolution]]). Formal [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|independence from Spain]] was declared on [[July 9]], [[1816]] in [[Tucuman|Tucumán]]. 
In 1817, General [[José de San Martín]] [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] to free [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], thus eliminating the Spanish threat. Centralist and federalist groups (Spanish: ''Unitarios'' and ''Federales'') were in conflict until national unity was established and the [[Constitution of Argentina|constitution]] promulgated in 1853.

Foreign [[investment]] and [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]] from Europe led to the adoption of modern agricultural techniques. In the 1880s, the "[[Conquest of the Desert]]" subdued or exterminated the remaining indigenous tribes throughout the southern [[Pampas]] and [[Patagonia]].<ref> Carlos A. Floria and César A. García Belsunce, 1971. ''Historia de los Argentinos'' I and II; ISBN 84-599-5081-6 </ref>

From 1880 to 1930, Argentina enjoyed increasing prosperity and prominence through an export-led economy, and the population of the country swelled sevenfold. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when their traditional rivals, the [[Radical Civic Union|Radicals]], won control of the government. The military forced [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] from power in 1930, leading to another decade of Conservative rule. Political change led to the presidency of [[Juan Perón]] in 1946, who tried to empower the working class and greatly expanded the number of unionized workers. The [[Revolución Libertadora]] of [[1955]] deposed him.

[[Image:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President [[Juan Perón]] (1946)]]

From the 1950s to 1970s, soft military and weak civilian administrations traded power. During those years the economy grew strongly and poverty declined (less than 7% in 1975), but became increasingly protectionist. At the same time political violence continued to escalate. In 1973, Perón returned to the presidency, but he died within a year of assuming power. His third wife [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], the Vice President, succeeded him in office, but the military coup of [[March 24]], [[1976]] removed her from office. 

The armed forces took power through a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] in charge of the self-appointed [[National Reorganization Process]] until 1983. The military government repressed opposition and terrorist leftist groups using harsh illegal measures (the "[[Dirty War]]"); thousands of dissidents "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]", while the [[SIDE]] cooperated with [[DINA]] and other South American intelligence agencies, and with the [[CIA]] in [[Operation Condor]]. Many of the military leaders that took part in the Dirty War were trained in the [[United States|U.S.]]-financed [[School of the Americas]], among them Argentine dictators [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] and [[Roberto Viola]]. Economic problems, charges of corruption, public revulsion in the face of [[human rights]] abuses and, finally, the country's 1982 defeat by the British in the [[Falklands War]] discredited the Argentine military regime. 

Democracy was restored in 1983. [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s Radical government took steps to account for the "disappeared", established civilian control of the armed forces, and consolidated democratic institutions. The members of the three military juntas were prosecuted and sentenced to life terms. Failure to resolve endemic economic problems and an inability to maintain public confidence led to Alfonsín's early departure six months before his term was to be completed.

President [[Carlos Menem]] imposed a [[Argentine peso|peso]]-[[United States dollar|dollar]] [[Argentine Currency Board|fixed exchange rate]] in 1991 to stop [[hyperinflation]] and adopted far-reaching market-based policies, dismantling [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers and business [[deregulation|regulations]], and implementing a [[privatization]] program. These reforms contributed to significant increases in investment and growth with stable prices through most of the 1990s.

[[Image:Cacerolazo Argentina 2001-2002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Protest against the ''[[corralito]]'' (2002)]]
The Menem and [[Fernando de la Rúa|de la Rúa]] administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports, massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment, chronic fiscal and trade deficits, and the contagion of several economic crises. The [[Asian financial crisis]] in [[1998]] precipitated an [[capital outflow|outflow of capital]] that mushroomed into a [[recession]], and culminated in a [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|financial panic]] in November of 2001. The next month, amidst [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|bloody riots]], President de la Rúa finally resigned.

In two weeks, several presidents followed in quick succession, culminating in [[Eduardo Duhalde]] being appointed interim [[President of Argentina]] by the Legislative Assembly on [[2 January]] 2002. Argentina [[default (finance)|defaulted]] on its international debt obligations. The peso's almost 11-year-old linkage to the U.S. dollar was abandoned, resulting in major [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] of the peso and a spike in [[inflation]].

With a more competitive and flexible exchange rate, the country started implementing new policies based on re-industrialization, [[import substitution]], increased exports, and consistent fiscal and trade surpluses. By the end of 2002, the economy began to stabilize. In [[2003]], [[Néstor Kirchner]] was elected president. During Kirchner's presidency, Argentina [[Argentine debt restructuring|restructured its defaulted debt]] with a steep discount (about 75 percent) on most bonds, payed off outstanding debts with the [[International Monetary Fund]], renegotiated contracts with utilities, and nationalized some previously privatized industries. Currently, Argentina is enjoying a period of high economic growth and increased political stability.

==Politics==
===Government===
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->

{{morepolitics|country=Argentina}}
Argentina's political framework is a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], in which the [[President of Argentina]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], complemented by a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. 
The [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]] mandates a [[separation of powers]] into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] branches at the national and provincial level.

[[executive (government)|Executive]] power resides in the [[President of Argentina|President]] and his cabinet. The [[President of Argentina|President]] and Vice President are directly elected to 4-year terms, limited to two consecutive terms, and the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers are appointed by the president.

[[legislature|Legislative]] power is vested in the bicameral [[National Congress]] or ''[[Argentine National Congress|Congreso de la Nación]]'', consisting of a [[Senate]] (''[[Argentine Senate|Senado]]'') of 72 seats, and a [[Chamber of Deputies]] (''[[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Cámara de Diputados]]'') of 257 members. 
Senators serve 6-year terms, with one-third standing for reelection every 2 years. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected to 4-year term via a system of [[proportional representation]], with half of the members of the [[lower house]] being elected every 2 years. A third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.

The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The [[Argentine Supreme Court of Justice]] has 9 members who are appointed by the President in consultation with the Senate. The rest of the judges are appointed by the [[Council of Magistrates of the Nation]], a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, the Congress, and the executive. (see also [[law of Argentina]])

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Argentina}}

Argentina is a member of [[Mercosur]], an international bloc which has some legislative supranational functions. Mercosur is composed of five full members: Argentina, [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]. It has five associate members without full voting rights: [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]].

[[Image:20 Años del Mercosur-Iguazu-Sarney-Lula-Kirchner-Alfonsín-Bielsa- 30-nov-05-presidencia-govar-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Current and Former Presidents of Brazil and Argentina on the 20th anniversary of the Mercosur.]]

Argentina was the only country from [[Latin America]] to participate in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] under mandate of the [[United Nations]], and in every phase of the [[Haiti]] operation. It has also contributed worldwide in [[peacekeeping]] operations, including in [[El Salvador]]-[[Honduras]]-[[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]], [[Ecuador]]-[[Peru]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Angola]], [[Kuwait]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[East Timor]]. In recognition of its contributions to international security, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] designated Argentina as a major non-NATO ally in January 1998. In 2005, it was elected as a temporary member of the [[UN Security Council]].

In 2005, on [[November 4]] and [[November 5]], the Argentine city of [[Mar del Plata]] hosted the [[Fourth Summit of the Americas]]. This summit was marked by a number of anti-U.S. protests. As of 2006, Argentina has been emphasizing [[Mercosur]] as its first international priority; by contrast, during the 1990s, it relied more heavily on its relationship with the [[United States]].

Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the [[Falkland Islands|Falkland/Malvinas Islands]], the [[South Shetland Islands]], the [[South Sandwich Islands]] and almost 1 million km² in Antarctica, between the 25°W and the 74°W meridians and the 60°S parallel. This slice of the continent is known as [[Argentine Antarctica]], which Argentina considers part of the national territory. For more than a century, there has been an Argentine presence at the [[Orcadas Base]]. Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

===Military===
The [[President of Argentina|President]] is the Commander-in-Chief, and the military is under the control of the Defense Ministry. Argentina's military establishement has historically been one of the best equipped in the region (for example, developing its own advanced jet fighters as early as the 1950s),<ref>[http://www.ipmsstockholm.org/magazine/2002/06/stuff_eng_profile_pulqui.htm Pulqui: Argentina's Jet Adventure]IPMStockholm.org</ref>  but has faced expenditure cutbacks in comparison to other regional militaries. The age of allowable military service is 18 years;  there is no obligatory [[military service]] and currently no [[conscription]].

The military is composed of a traditional [[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]], and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]. Controlled by a separate ministry (the Interior Ministry), Argentine territorial waters are patrolled by the 
[[Argentine Naval Prefecture|Naval Prefecture]], and the border regions by the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie|National Gendarmerie]]; both branches however maintain liasions with the Defense Ministry. They mostly perform patrols against [[organized crime]], [[drug smuggling]], and rescue operations of civilians in distress. Argentina's Armed Forces are currently performing major operations in [[Haiti]] and [[Cyprus]], in accordance to specified UN mandates.

==Administrative divisions==
[[Image:Argentina - Político 2.png|thumb|340px|Provinces of Argentina. Argentina claims control of the [[Falkland Islands]] (Islas Malvinas) and a slice of [[Antarctica]], both of which it considers a part of its [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego Province]] (23).]]
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}

<sup>*</sup> The current official name for the [[federal district]] is ''Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires''.

Buenos Aires has been the capital of Argentina since its unification, but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere. During the presidency of [[Raúl Alfonsín]] a law was passed ordering the transfer of the federal capital to [[Viedma]], a city in the [[Patagonian]] province of Río Negro. Studies were underway when economic problems killed the project in 1989. Though the law was never formally repealed, it has become a mere historical relic, and the project has been forgotten.

Provinces are divided into smaller secondary units called ''departamentos'', or [[Departments of Argentina|departments]]. There are 376 departments. The province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] has 134 similar divisions known as ''partidos''. ''Departamentos''  and ''partidos'' are further subdivided into municipalities or districts.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[Image:Argentina topo blank.jpg|260px|thumb|left|Topographic map of Argentina (Including some territorial claims)]]

===Main features===
The total surface area of Argentina (not including the Antarctic claim), is as follows:

* Total: [[1 E12 m²|2,766,890]] [[square kilometre|km²]]
* Land: 2,736,690 km² 
* Water: 30,200 km² 

Argentina is nearly 3,700 km long from north to south, and 1,400 km from east to west (maximum values). It can roughly be divided into four parts: the fertile plains of the [[Pampa]]s in the center the country, the source of Argentina's [[agriculture|agricultural]] wealth; the flat to rolling, oil-rich plateau of [[Patagonia]] in the southern half down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; the subtropical flats of the [[Gran Chaco]] in the north, and the rugged [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]]. 

The highest point above [[sea level]] in Argentina is located in [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Cerro [[Aconcagua]], at 6,962 [[meter]]s (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]), is the highest mountain in the [[Americas]], the [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]],<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~igpl/Mountains.html Mountains of the Earth] The Highest Mountain Peak on Each Continent</ref> and [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref>[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150197/aconcagua.html Aconcagua, the highest in the Western Hemisphere]</ref>  The lowest point is [[Laguna del Carbón]] in [[Santa Cruz Province|Santa Cruz]], −105 meters (−344 feet) below sea level.<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~igpl/Depressions.html Depressions] The The Lowest Surface Point on Each Continent</ref> This is also the lowest point on the South American [[continent]]. The geographic center of the country is located in south-central [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] province.

The country has a territorial claim over a portion of [[Argentine Antarctica|Antarctica]], where it has maintaned a constant occupied presence for more than a [[Orcadas Base|century]], starting in 1904.

===Geographic regions===
The country is traditionally divided into several major geographically distinct regions:

*Pampas: The plains west and south from [[Buenos Aires]] are some of the most fertile in the world. Called the Humid Pampa, they cover most of the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] and [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]], and big portions of the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]]. The western part of [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] and the province [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] also have plains (the Dry Pampa), but they are drier and used mainly for grazing. The [[Sierra de Córdoba]] in the homonymous province (extending into San Luis), is the most important geographical feature of the pampas.
*Gran Chaco: The [[Gran Chaco]] region in the north of the country is seasonal dry/wet, mainly cotton growing and livestock raising. It covers the provinces of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] and [[Formosa Province|Formosa]]. It is dotted with subtropical forests, scrubland, and some wetlands, home to a large number of plant and animal species. The province of [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]] lies in the drier region of the Gran Chaco.
*Mesopotamia: The land between the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] rivers is called [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] and it is shared by the provinces of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] and [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]. It features flatland apt for grazing and plant growing, and the [[Iberá Wetlands]] in central Corrientes. [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] province is more tropical and belongs within the [[Brazilian Highlands]] geographic feature. It features subtropical rainforests and the [[Iguazú Falls]].
*Patagonia: The [[steppe]]s of [[Patagonia]], in the provinces of [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] and [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]], are of [[Tertiary]] origin. Most of the region is semiarid in the north to cold and arid in the far south, but forests grow in its western fringes which are dotted with several large lakes. [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] is cool and wet, moderated by oceanic influences. Northern Patagonia (roughly Río Negro south of the homonymous river, and Neuquén) can also be referred as the '''Comahue''' [[Comahue|region]] (not commonly in use).
*Cuyo: West-central Argentina is dominated by the imposing [[Andes]] Mountains. To their east is the arid region known as [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]]. Melting waters from high in the mountains form the backbone of irrigated lowland oasis, at the center of a rich fruit and [[wine]] growing region in [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] and [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] provinces. Further north the region gets hotter and drier with more geographical accidents in [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] province.
*NOA or Noroeste: This region is the highest in average elevation. Several parallel mountain ranges, several of which have peaks higher than 20,000 feet, dominate the area. These ranges grow wider in geographic extent towards the north. They are cut by fertile river valleys, the most important being the [[Calchaquí Valleys]] in the provinces of [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], and [[Salta Province|Salta]]. Farther north the province of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] near [[Bolivia]] lies mainly within the [[Altiplano]] plateau of the Central Andes. The [[Tropic of Capricorn]] goes through the far north of the region.

===Rivers and lakes===

Major [[river]]s in Argentina include the [[Pilcomayo River|Pilcomayo]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Río Negro River (Argentina)|Río Negro]], [[Salado River|Salado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. The latter two flow together before meeting the [[Atlantic Ocean]], forming the estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]]. Regionally important rivers are the [[Atuel River|Atuel]] and [[Mendoza River|Mendoza]] in the homonymous province, the [[Chubut River|Chubut]] in Patagonia, the Río Grande in Jujuy, and the San Francisco River in Salta.

There are several large [[lake]]s in Argentina, many of them in Patagonia. Among these are lakes [[Lake Argentino|Argentino]] and [[Lake Viedma|Viedma]] in Santa Cruz, [[Lake Nahuel Huapi|Nahuel Huapi]] in Río Negro and [[Lake Fagnano|Fagnano]] in Tierra del Fuego, and Colhué Huapi and Musters in Chubut. [[Lake Buenos Aires]] and [[O'Higgins/San Martín Lake]] are shared with Chile. [[Mar Chiquita, Córdoba]], is the largest salt water lake in the country. There are numerous [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s created by [[dam]]s. Argentina features various [[hot spring]]s, such as those at [[Termas de Río Hondo]] with temperatures between 30°C and 65°C.<ref>[http://www.liveargentina.com/SantiagodelEsteroRioHondo.htm About Termas de Río Hondo].</ref>

===Coastal areas and seas===
Argentina has 2,665 kilometers (1,656mi) of [[coastline]].<ref>[http://www.natlaw.com/pubs/sparcs1.htm Global Argentina]</ref> The continental platform is unusually wide; in Argentina this shallow area of the [[Atlantic]] [[Ocean]] is called [[Mar Argentino]]. The waters are rich in fisheries and suspected of holding important [[hydrocarbon]] energy resources. Argentina's coastline varies between areas of [[sand]] dunes and [[cliff]]s. The two major [[ocean current]]s affecting the coast are the warm [[Brazil Current]] and the cold [[Falkland Current]] (Spanish: ''corriente Antártica''). Because of the uneveness of the coastal landmass, the two currents alternate in their influence on climate and do not allow temperatures to fall evenly with higher latitude. The southern coast of [[Tierra del Fuego]] forms the north shore of the [[Drake Passage]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Salta-VallesCalchaquies-P3140151.JPG|thumb|250px|Calchaquí Valleys in the province of Salta]]
Because of longitudinal and elevation amplitudes, Argentina is subject to a variety of climates. As a rule, the [[climate]] is predominantly [[temperate climate|temperate]] with extremes ranging from [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] in the north to subpolar in the far south. The north of the country is characterized by very hot, humid summers with mild drier winters, and is subject to periodic droughts. Central Argentina has hot summers with thunderstorms (in western Argentina producing some of the world's largest [[hail]]), and cool winters. The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy [[snow]]fall, specially in moutainous zones. Higher elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions.

The hottest and coldest [[temperature]] extremes recorded in [[South America]] have occurred in Argentina. A record high temperature of 48.8&nbsp;[[degree Celsius|°C]] (120&nbsp;[[degree Fahrenheit|°F]]), was recorded at Rivadavia, [[Salta Province|Salta]] on [[December 11]] [[1905]]. The lowest temperature recorded was &minus;32.7 °C (&minus;27&nbsp;°F) at Sarmiento, [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], June 1st, 1907.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation]</ref>

Major winds in Argentina include the cool [[Pampero]] blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the ''Pampas'' after a [[cold front]]; the [[Viento Norte]], a warm wind that can blow from the north in mid and late winter creating mild conditions; and the [[Zonda wind|Zonda]], a hot and dry wind ([[Föhn wind|''see'' Föhn wind]]), affecting west-central Argentina. Squeezed of all moisture during the 6,000 meter descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120 [[kilometre per hour|km/h]], fueling [[wildfire]]s and causing damage. When the Zonda blows (June-November), snowstorms and [[blizzard]] (''viento blanco'') conditions usually affect the higher elevations.

The [[Sudestada]] (literally "southeaster") could be considered similar to the [[Noreaster]], though snowfall is rarely involved (but is not unprecedented). Both are associated with a deep winter low pressure system. The ''sudestada'' usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas, and coastal [[flood]]ing. It is most common in late [[autumn]] and [[winter]] along the coasts of central Argentina and in the Río de la Plata [[estuary]].

The southern regions, particularly the far south, experience long periods of daylight from November to February (up to 19 hours), and extended nights from May to August. All of Argentina uses [[UTC-3]] time zone. The country does not observe [[daylight savings]].

Argentina's eastermost continental point is northeast of the town of [[Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones|Bernardo de Irigoyen]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] ({{coor dm|26|15|S|53|38|W|}}), the westernmost in the Mariano Moreno Range in [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]] ({{coor dm|49|33|S|73|35|W|}}). The northermost point is located at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers, [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] ({{coor dm|21|46|S|66|13|W|}}), and the southernmost is Cape San Pío in [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] ({{coor dm|55|03|S|66|31|W|}}).<ref>[http://www.hcdsc.gov.ar/biblioteca/ISES/geografiaargentina.asp Argentine topography, hydrography, and climate] Chamber of Deputies of the Province of Santa Cruz (Spanish)</ref>

===Enclaves and exclaves===
There is one Argentine [[exclave]], the [[Martín García Island]] (co-ordinates {{coor dm|34|11|S|58|15|W|}}). It is near the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, a kilometre (0.62&nbsp;mi) inside [[Uruguay]]an waters, and 3.5 kilometres (2.1 mi) from the Uruguayan coastline near the small town of [[Martín Chico]] (itself halfway between [[Nueva Palmira]] and [[Colonia del Sacramento]]).

An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in 1973 reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute. Under the terms of the agreement, Martín García is to be devoted exclusively as a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&nbsp;[[acre]]s), and its population is about 200 people.

==Flora and fauna==
===Vegetation===
[[Image:Erythrina_crista-galli2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Ceibo]] is Argentina's national flower]]
Subtropical plants dominate the north, part of the [[Gran Chaco]] region of [[South America]]. The [[genus]] [[Dalbergia]] of trees is well disseminated with representatives like the ''brazilian jacaranda'' and the ''quebracho'' tree; also predominant are white and black ''algarrobo'' trees ([[prosopis alba]] and [[prosopis nigra]]). ''Savannah''-like areas exist in the drier regions nearer the [[Andes]]. Acquatic plants thrive in the wetlands dotting the region.

In central Argentina the ''humid [[pampas]]'' are a true [[tallgrass prairie]] [[ecosystem]]. The original ''pampa'' had virtually no [[trees]]; today along roads or in towns and country estates (''estancias''), some imported species like the [[American sycamore]] or [[eucalyptus]] are present. The only tree-like plant native to the ''pampa'' is the [[ombu|ombú]], an evergreen. The surface soils of the ''pampa'' are a deep black color, primarily ''humus'', known commonly as [[compost]]. It is this which makes the region one of the most agriculturaly productive on [[Earth]]. However, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial [[agriculture]]. The western ''pampas'' receive less rainfall, this ''dry pampa'' is a plain of short grasses or [[steppe]].<ref>[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentinien#Flora_und_Fauna Flora und Fauna] Argentinien- Wikipedia Die Freie Enzyklopädie</ref>

Most of [[Patagonia]] in the south lies within a ''rain shade'' of the [[Andes]]. The plantlife, shrubby bushes and plants, is well suited to widthstand dry conditions. The soil is hard and rocky making large-scale [[farming]] impossible except along [[river valleys]]. [[Coniferous]] forests grow in far western Patagonia and on the [[island]] of [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Conifers native to the region include [[Fitzroya|alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), [[Austrocedrus|ciprés de la cordillera]] (''Austrocedrus chilensis''), [[Pilgerodendron|ciprés de las guaitecas]] (''Pilgerodendron uviferum''), [[Podocarpus nubigenus|huililahuán]] (''Podocarpus nubigenus''), [[Prumnopitys andina|lleuque]] (''Prumnopitys andina''), [[Saxegothaea|mañío hembra]] (''Saxegothaea conspicua''), and [[Araucaria araucana|pehuén]] (''Araucaria araucana''), while native broadleaf trees include several species of ''[[Nothofagus]]'' including coigüe or [[coihue]], [[Nothofagus pumilio|lenga]] (''Nothofagus pumilio''), [[ñire]] (''Nothofagus antarctica''). Other introduced trees present in [[forestry]] [[plantation]]s include [[spruce]], [[cypress]], and [[pine]]. Common plants are the [[Lapageria rosea|copihue]] and colihue (''[[Chusquea coleou]]'').<ref>[http://www.adventure-tours-south.com/flofau.htm] Animals in Argentina</ref>

In [[Cuyo]], semiarid thorny bushes and other [[xerophile]] plants abound. Along the many river [[oasis]], grasses and trees grow in significant numbers. The area presents optimal conditions for the large scale growth of [[grape vine]]s. In the northwest of Argentina there are many species of [[cactus|cactii]]. In the highest elevations (often above 4,000mts), no vegetation grows due to the extreme altitude, and the soils are virtually devoid of any plant life. 

The ''ceibo'' flower (belonging to the tree [[Erythrina crista-galli]]), is the national flower of Argentina.

===Animal life===
Many species live in the subtropical north. Big cats like the [[jaguar]], [[puma]], and [[ocelot]]; primates ([[howler monkey]]); large reptiles ([[crocodiles]]), and a species of [[caiman]]. Other animals include the [[tapir]], [[capybara]], [[anteater]], [[ferret]], [[raccoon]], and various species of [[turtle]] and [[tortoise]]. There are many birds,  notably [[hummingbirds]], [[flamingos]], [[toucans]], and [[parrots]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/fotosaves] Fotos de Animales Silvestres de Argentina</ref>

[[Image:Condor flying over the Colca canyon in Peru.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Condor in flight]]
The central grasslands are populated by the [[armadillo]], [[pampas cat]], and the [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] (''ñandú''), a flightless bird. [[Hawks]], [[falcons]], [[herons]], [[partridges]] inhabit the region. There are also [[deer]] and [[foxes]]. Some of these species extend into [[Patagonia]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/fotosaves] Fotos de Animales Silvestres de Argentina</ref>

The western mountains are home to different animals. These include the [[llama]], [[guanaco]], [[vicuna|vicuña]], among the most recognizable species of [[South America]]. Also in this region are the [[jackal]], [[andean cat]], and the largest flying bird in the New World, the [[condor]]. 

Southern Argentina is home to the [[Puma]], [[Huemul (zoology)|huemul]], [[pudú]] (the world's smallest deer), and [[wild boar]].<ref>[http://www.adventure-tours-south.com/flofau.htm] Animals in Argentina</ref>  The coast of [[Patagonia]] is rich in animal life: [[elephant seals]], [[fur seals]], [[sea lions]], and species of [[penguin]]. The far south is populated by [[cormorant]] birds.

The territorial waters of Argentina have abundant ocean life; mammals such as [[dolphins]], [[orca]]s, and whales like the southern [[right whale]], a major tourist draw for naturalists. Sea fish include [[sardines]], [[hake|argentine hakes]], [[pompano dolphinfish|dolphinfish]], [[salmon]], and [[sharks]]; also present are [[squid]] and [[spider crab]] (''centolla'') in [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Rivers and streams in Argentina have many species of [[trout]] and the South American [[Dourado (Salminus)|dorado]] fish.<ref>[http://www.fishing-arg.com.ar Fishing and Argentina] Dorado vs. Trouts</ref>  Outstanding snake species inhabiting Argentina include [[boa constrictor]]s, and the very [[venomous]] ''yacará'' [[pit viper]] and south American [[rattle snake]].

The [[Hornero]] was elected the National Bird after a survey in 1928.<ref>[http://www.redargentina.com/Faunayflora/Aves/hornero.asp] Info about Hornero</ref>

==Economy==
===Recent developments===
[[Image:Pesosargentinos.jpg|thumb|200px|Current Argentine peso bills]]
{{main|Economy of Argentina}}
Argentina benefits from rich [[natural resource]]s, a highly [[literate]] population, an export-oriented [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, and a diversified [[industry|industrial]] base. The country historically had a large middle class compared to other Latin American countries, but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises. Today, while a significant segment of the population is still financially well-off, they stand in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it. Since 2002, there has been an improvement in the situation of the poorer sectors and a strong rebound of the middle class.

Since the late 1970s, the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high [[inflation]]. In 1991, the government [[fixed exchange rate|pegged]] the peso to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] and limited the growth in the [[monetary base]]. The government then embarked on a path of [[free trade|trade liberalization]], [[deregulation]], and [[privatization]]. Inflation dropped and the [[gross domestic product]] grew, but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits, causing it to crumble in slow motion, from 1995 and up to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|collapse in 2001]].

By 2002, Argentina had [[default (finance)|defaulted]] on its debt, its GDP had shrunk, [[unemployment]] was more than 25%, and the peso had [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] 75% after being [[devaluation|devalued]] and [[floating exchange rate|floated]]. However, careful spending control and heavy [[tax]]es on now-soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct [[monetary policy]].

[[Image:Buenos Aires-Puerto Madero-Hilton-River View.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Hilton Hotel to the right of River View Towers, Buenos Aires]]
In 2003, [[import substitution]] policies and soaring [[export]]s coupled with lower inflation and expansive economic measures, triggered a surge in the GDP. It was repeated in 2004 and 2005, creating millions of jobs and encouraging internal consumption. [[Capital flight]] decreased, and [[foreign investment]] slowly returned. The influx of foreign currency from exports created a huge [[trade surplus]]. The Central Bank was forced to buy dollars from the market, and continues to do a various times today to be accumulated as [[reserve currency|reserves]]. It does this to prevent the argentine peso from appreciating significantly and cutting competitiveness.

The situation by 2006 was further improved, the year is on track to match the large GDP growth of the last three (predictions are between 7.3 and 8.0%), though inflation, estimated at around 10 to 12%, has become an issue again, and [[income distribution]] is still considerably unequal.<ref>International Monetary Fund. 
[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/pdf/c1.pdf Economic Prospects and Policy Issues] (PDF).</ref><ref>InfoBAE, 20 Sep 2006. [http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=276924&IdxSeccion=100895 ''Para los bancos la Argentina seguirá creciendo en 2006Agregar a mis artículos''].</ref> In a variety of reports, internationals organizations criticize Argentina for remaining a somewhat closed economy.

Even as the effects of the crisis have abated but not disappeared, Argentina remains one of the most developed countries in Latin America. It boasts the highest [[GDP per capita]] based on [[purchasing power parity]], and the 3rd highest in US$ (nominal) GDP. The country enjoys the highest levels of education measured by university attendance, and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects equals that found in fully industrialized nations.

In 2002, 57,5% of the population was below the [[poverty]] line, but the last report of August 2006 showed a 31,4% poverty level. Similarly, unemployment was more than 25 percent, by July 2006 it was 10.2 percent. GDP per capita has surpassed the previous pre-recession peak of 1998 in PPP, but still lags in nominal GDP, mostly due to an undervalued currency. The economy grew 8.9 percent in 2003, 9.0 percent in 2004, and 9.2 percent in 2005. As of 2006 foreign debt stands at 68 percent of GDP and is slowly decreasing.<ref>*[http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=96&row=2 Who Shot Argentina?

===Sectors===
[[Image:Buenos Aires-Puente de la Mujer.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Santiago Calatrava|Calatrava]]'s Women's Bridge in Puerto Madero]]

In 2004, [[Agriculture|agricultural]] output accounted for 11% of [[GDP]], and one third of all exports.  [[Soy]] and [[vegetable oils]] are major export [[commodity|commodities]] at 24% of exports. [[Wheat]], [[maize]], [[oats]], [[sorghum]], and [[sunflower seeds]] totalled 8%.<ref>[http://www.indec.gov.ar INDEC]</ref>  [[Cattle]] is also a major industry. [[Beef]], [[milk]], [[leather]] products, and [[cheese]] were 6% of total exports.<ref>[http://www.indec.gov.ar INDEC]</ref>  [[Sheep]] and [[wool]] industries are important in [[Patagonia]], [[pigs]] and [[caprine]]s elsewhere. 

[[Fruits]] and [[vegetables]] made up 3% of exports: [[apples]] and [[pears]] in the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] valley; [[oranges]] and other [[citrus]] in the [[argentine Northwest|northwest]] and [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|mesopotamia]]; [[grapes]] and [[strawberries]] in [[Cuyo]], and [[berries]] in the far south.  [[Cotton]] and [[yerba mate]] are major crops in the [[Gran Chaco]], [[sugarcane]] and [[tobacco]] in the northwest, and [[olives]] and [[garlic]] in Cuyo. [[Bananas]] ([[Formosa]]), [[tomatoes]] ([[Salta Province|Salta]]), and [[peaches]] (Mendoza) are grown for domestic consumption.  Argentina is the world's 5th [[wine]] producer, and fine wine production has taken major leaps in quality. A growing export, total [[viticulture]] potential is far from met. [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] is the largest wine region, followed by [[San Juan Province|San Juan]].<ref>[http://www.francoargentine.com/Espanol/PArg/vinos.htm La Franco Argentine](Spanish)</ref>

Industrial [[petrochemicals]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[natural gas]] are Argentina's 2nd group of exports, 20% of totals. The most important [[oil field]]s lie in [[Patagonia]] and [[Cuyo]]. An impressive network of [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] send raw product to [[Bahia Blanca]], center of the petrochemical industry, and to the [[La Plata, Argentina|La Plata]]-[[Rosario, Argentina|Rosario]] industrial belt.  [[Coal]] is also mined.

[[Mining]] is a rising industry. The [[Argentine Northwest|northwest]] and [[San Juan Province]] are main regions of activity. Metals mined include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], [[sulfur]], [[tungsten]] and [[uranium]]. In only ten years exports soared from US$ 200 million to 1.2 billion in 2004, 3% of total..<ref> [http://www.inversiones.gov.ar/documentos/mineria.pdf Investing in Argentina: Mining]Economy Ministry of Argentina (Spanish)</ref>  Estimates for 2006 are US$ 2bn, a 10 fold rise from 1996.

In [[fisheries]], [[hake|argentine hake]] accounts for 50% of catches, [[pollack]] and [[squid]] follow. [[Forestry]] has expanded in [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|mesopotamia]]; [[elm]] for [[cellulose]], [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]] for furniture, [[timber]] and [[paper]] products. Both sectors account for 2% of exports each.

[[Image:Central vista externa en gris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Yaciretá Dam]] hydroelectric complex is the 2nd largest in the world]]
[[Manufacturing]] is the nation's leading single sector in GDP output, with 35% of the share.<ref>[http://www.indec.gov.ar INDEC]</ref> Leading sectors are [[automobile|motor vehicle]]s, [[auto part]]s, and [[transportation]] and [[tractor|farming]] equipment (7% of exports), [[iron]] and [[steel]] (3%), [[food processing|foodstuffs]] and [[textiles]] (2%). Other manufactures include [[cement]], industrial [[chemicals]], [[major appliance|home appliances]], and processed [[wood]]. The biggest industrial centers are [[Buenos Aires]], Rosario and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].

The [[Services|service sector]] is the biggest contributor to total GDP. Argentina produces energy in large part through well developed [[hydroelectric]] resources; [[nuclear energy]] is also of high importance.<ref>[http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/divulgacion/reactores/c_reactores_fii.html Themes in Nuclear Energy and Physics ]www.cnea.gov.ar</ref> The country is one of the largest producers and exporters (with [[Canada]] and [[Russia]]) of [[Cobalt-60]], a [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] widely used in [[cancer]] therapy.

Regular [[telephone]] (85% of households) and [[mail]] are robust. [[Construction]] has led employment creation in the current economic expansion, and is 5% of GDP. 

[[Tourism]] is increasingly important, now providing 7% of economic output. Argentines are travelling more within their borders, and foreign arrivals are flocking to a country seen as affordable, safe, and incredibly diverse: Cosmopolitan [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Rosario, Argentina|Rosario]], incomparable [[Iguazu Falls]] and colonial [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]]. From native amerindian [[Jujuy Province]] to fun filled [[Córdoba Province|Córdoba]], the [[wineries]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]; skiing in scenic [[Bariloche]] to the beaches of [[Pinamar]], and [[Perito Moreno Glacier]] to legendary [[Tierra del Fuego Province|Tierra del Fuego]]. 3.7 million tourists visited in 2005.<ref>[http://www.hostnews.com.ar/2006/prin/mar/020401.htm www.hostnews.com.ar]</ref>

===Transportation===
[[Image:Puente Rosario-Victoria 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A cargo ship in front of the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]]]]

Argentina's [[highway]] system is well developed and paved roads reach all corners of the country. There are nearly 640,000 kilometers of highways and roads. Multilane highways now connect several main cities and more are now under construction. 

The [[railway]] network was one of the largest in the world, at over 40,000 kilometers of tracks. In 1992 most passenger services shut down when the rail company was privatized, and thousands of kilometers of track are in disrepair. Currentely, railway services are being reactivated between several cities, along with upgrades in the system. A [[high-speed train]] project between Buenos Aires and Rosario is due to breakground in 2007.

The country has around 3,000 kilometers of [[waterways]], most significant among these the [[Rio de la Plata]], [[Parana River|Parana]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]] rivers.

==Population==
===Current figures===
The [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina]] (INDEC) 2001 [[census]] showed the population of Argentina was 36,260,130. It ranks 3rd in [[South America]] in total population and 30th globally. The 2005 estimate is for a population of 38,747,000. Argentina's [[population density]] is 14 people per square kilometer. However, the population is not evenly distributed: areas of the city of Buenos Aires have a population density of over 14,000/km², while Santa Cruz province has less than 1/km². Argentina is the only nation in Latin America with a net positive [[migration]] rate, of about +0.6 persons.

===Cities and metropolitan areas===
The 15 largest metropolitan areas of Argentina as of 2005 are as follows:

==Demographics==

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DSC04986.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Argentinians enjoying a summer day, Buenos Aires.]]  -->
{{main|Demographics of Argentina}}

More than any other Latin American country, Argentina's population is of European origin. Most of the population is made up of descendants of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Italy|Italian]], and other European settlers. 

===Europeans===
After the regimented Spanish colonists, waves of European [[immigration in Argentina|immigrants]] settled in Argentina from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries. Major contributors include [[Italy]] (notably [[Campania]], [[Piedmont]], [[Calabria]], [[Veneto]], [[Lombardy]]),<ref>[http://www.feditalia.org.ar/arg/federaciones/feditalia_org_fed_regionales.html Federaciones Regionales] www.feditalia.org.ar</ref> [[Spain]] (foremost among them ethnic [[Basques]], [[Galicians]], and [[Catalans]]), and [[France]] (mostly to Buenos Aires and Mendoza). Smaller but significant numbers of immigrants came from [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] (in the so-called Lakes Region of Patagonia; also Córdoba), [[Scandinavia]] ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]), the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (to Buenos Aires, Santa Fé, and Patagonia), and [[Portugal]]. Eastern Europeans were also numerous, from [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Lithuania]], as well as [[Balkan]] nations ([[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]], particularly in Chaco). There is a large [[Armenian]] community, and the patagonian Chubut Valley has a significant [[Wales|Welsh]]-descended population. The majority of Argentina's Jewish community (the largest in Latin America and fifth worldwide) derives from immigrants of north and eastern European origin ([[Ashkenazi Jews]]), and about 15-20% from [[Sephardic]] groups from Spain or [[Muslim]] nations. Many [[Syrians]] and [[Lebanese]] chose to emigrate to Argentina, which prior to [[1924]] were recorded as arrivals from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

===Minorities===
The largest ethnic minority is the [[mestizo]] (European/Amerindian) population, specially in the northern provinces. Estimates range from 3 to 15%. In recent decades, especially during the 1990s, there has been an influx of immigrants from neighboring countries. Principally from [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Peru]].

[[Image:GauchoArgen.jpg|thumb|250px|Argentine Gaucho]]
Small but growing numbers of people from East Asia have also settled Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires. The first Asian-Argentines were of [[Japan|Japanese]] descent,  [[Korea|Koreans]], [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]], and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] followed. The [[China|Chinese]] population alone has risen dramatically, now at over 60,000.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/09/22/conexiones/t-01276347.htm Jóvenes Argenchinos] Clarin.com Sep 22, 2006</ref>  Argentina is home to a significant [[refugee]] population from [[Laos]]. 

Argentina has a large Arab community, made up mostly of immigrants from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Many have gained prominent status in national business and politics, including former president [[Carlos Menem]], the son of Syrian settlers from the province of La Rioja.

The officially recognized [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population in the country, according to the [http://www.indec.mecon.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp 2005 Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples], stands at approximately 318,700 people (0.8 percent of the total population), who are either members or first-generation descendants of a recognized indigenous community. These parameters may imply an under-count, as most indigenous Argentines are no longer tribally affiliated; in some circumstances they have not been for several generations.

{{see also|Welsh settlement in Argentina|Asian-Argentines|}}

===Illegal immigrants===
[[Illegal immigration]] has been a relatively important population factor in recent Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]], countries which border Argentina to the north.  Smaller numbers arrive from [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Romania]], and [[China]]. The number of stowaways inside incoming ships from [[West Africa]] have increased in recent times.  The Argentine government estimates 750,000 are undocumented and has launched a program called ''Patria Grande'' ("Greater Homeland"),<ref>[http://www.patriagrande.gov.ar ''Patria Grande'']</ref>  to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far some 200,000 applications have been processed under the program.  Other unofficial estimates suggest that over one million people reside in Argentina illegally.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14640268/site/newsweek/%20.

===Urbanization===
{{main|List of cities in Argentina}}

[[Image:Tucumán-Casa-Gobierno-1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Government house of Tucumán]]
[[Image:Mar-del-plata.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Beach on the Atlantic Ocean, [[Mar del Plata]]]]
Argentina's population is very highly urbanized. About 2.7 million people live in the autonomous city of [[Buenos Aires]], and 11.5 million in [[Gran Buenos Aires|Greater Buenos Aires]] (2001), making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. Together with their respective [[metropolitan area]]s, the second- and third-largest cities in Argentina, [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Rosario]], comprise about 1.3 and 1.1 million inhabitants, respectively.

Most European [[immigration in Argentina|immigrants to Argentina]] settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the [[middle class]]. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities.

The 1990s saw many rural towns become [[ghost town]]s when train services ceased and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of cheap imported goods. Many slums (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities, inhabited by empoverished lower-class urban dwellers, migrants from smaller towns in the interior, and also a large number of immigrants from neighbouring countries that came during the time of the convertibility and did not leave after the 2001 crisis.

Argentina's urban areas have a European look, reflecting the influence of European settlers. Many cities are built in a Spanish-grid style around a main square called a ''plaza''. A cathedral and important government buildings often face the ''plaza''. The general layout of the cities is called a ''damero'', or checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks, though modern developments sometimes depart from it (the city of La Plata, built at the end of the 19th century, is organized as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals).

==Culture==
[[Image:Buenos_Aires-Center-P3050007.JPG|thumb|180px|European and modern styles in Buenos Aires]]
{{main|Culture of Argentina}}

Argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its European roots. [[Buenos Aires]], considered by many its cultural capital, is often said to be the most European city in [[South America]], due both to the prevalence of people of European descent and to conscious imitation. The other big influence on the development of a national identity is the culture of the [[gauchos]] and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance. Finally, indigenous American traditions (like [[yerba mate|mate tea]] drinking) have been absorbed into the greater cultural realm.

===Literature===
{{main|Argentine literature}}
Argentina has a rich history of world-renowned literature, including one of 20th century's most critically acclaimed writers, [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. The country has been a leader in Latin American literature since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s, with a strong constitution and a defined nation-building plan. The struggle between the Unitarians (who favored a loose [[confederation]] of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Federalists (pro-[[liberalism]] and advocates of a strong federal government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time. 
[[Image:Jose_Hernandez_Argentino.jpg|thumb|left|José Hernández was the author of the epic tale The Gaucho [[Martín Fierro]]]]
The ideological divide between [[gaucho]] epic ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' by [[José Hernández]], and ''Facundo''<ref>e-libro.net. Free digital books. [http://www.e-libro.net/E-libro-viejo/gratis/facundo.pdf ''Facundo''].</ref> by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], is a great example. Hernández favored the pastoral lifestyle of early Argentina and vehemently opposed European immigration. Sarmiento wrote immigration was the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial ''[[caudillo]]'' families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and enlightened to Western European thought, and therefore a more prosperous society. 

Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the [[modernist literature|modernist]] movement, which emerged in [[France]] in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with [[Ricardo Güiraldes]] as an important reference. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is Argentina's most acclaimed writer. Borges found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories such as ''[[Ficciones]]'' and ''[[The Aleph]]''. 

Argentina has produced many more internationally noted writers, poets, and intellectuals: [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[Roberto Arlt]], [[Enrique Banchs]], [[Adolfo Bioy Casares|Adolfo Bioy Cásares]], [[Eugenio Cambaceres]], [[Julio Cortazar|Julio Cortázar]], [[Esteban Echeverria]], [[Leopoldo Lugones]], [[Eduardo Mallea]], [[Ezequiel Martinez Estrada|Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]], [[Tomás Eloy Martínez]], [[Victoria Ocampo]], [[Manuel Puig]], [[Ernesto Sabato]], [[Osvaldo Soriano]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], and [[Maria Elena Walsh|María Elena Walsh]]. The one and only [[Quino]] (born ''Joaquin Salvador Lavado''), has entertained readers the world over, while dipping into the events of modern times, with soup-hating [[Mafalda]] and her [[comic strip]] gang.

===Film and theater===
[[Image:Buenos Aires-Av. 9 de julio.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[9 de Julio Avenue|Nueve de Julio Avenue]], the world's widest avenue. Its name honors Argentine Independence Day (July 9, 1816).]]

Argentina is a major producer of [[motion pictures]]. The world's first animated films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]]. [[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] enjoyed a 'golden age' in the 1930s through the 1950s with scores of productions, many now considered classics of Spanish-language film. More recent films have achieved worldwide recognition, such as ''[[The Official Story]]'', ''[[Nine Queens]]'', ''[[Man Facing Southeast]]'', ''[[Son of the Bride]]'', ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', or ''[[Iluminados por el Fuego]]''. Although rarely rivaling [[Hollywood]]-type movies in popularity, local films are released weekly and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. Even low-budget films have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as [[Cannes]]). The city of [[Mar del Plata]] organizes its [[Mar del Plata Film Festival|own film festival]], while Buenos Aires has its [[Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema|independent cinema counterpart]]. The per capita number of screens is one of the highest in Latin America, and viewing per capita is the highest in the region. A new generation of Argentine directors has caught the attention of critics worldwide.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/4862388.stm About Gavin Esler's Argentina diary ]news.bbc.co.uk [[3 April]] 2006</ref> 

Buenos Aires is one of the great capitals of [[theater]]. Besides the ''Teatro Colón'' ([[Colon Theater]], one of the great [[opera houses]] of the world) with its caliber national and international program, ''Calle Corrientes'', or [[Corrientes Avenue]], is synonymous with the art. It is dubbed 'the street that never sleeps', and sometimes referred to as the [[Broadway]] of Buenos Aires.<ref name="Adams" >{{cite book |author=Adams, Fiona. |title=Culture Shock Argentina |publisher=Graphic Arts Center Publishing Company |location=Portland, OR |id=ISBN 1-55868-529-4 |year=2001}}</ref> Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. ''The Teatro General San Martín'' is one of the most prestigious along Calle Corrientes; the ''Teatro Nacional Cervantes'' is designated the national theater of Argentina. Another important theater is the ''Independencia'' in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Florencio Sanchez and [[Griselda Gambaro]] are famous argentine playwrights. [[Julio Bocca]] is one of the great [[ballet dancers]] of the modern era.

===Painting and sculpture===
[[Image:BQM Dia de Sol (1958).jpg|thumb|150px|left|'''Día de Sol''' (''Sunny Day'') by Benito Quinquela Martín. ([[1958]])]]
Perhaps one of the most enigmatic figures of argentine culture is Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari, ''aka'' [[Xul Solar]], whose watercolour syle and unorthodox painting media draws large crowds at museums worldwide; he also 'invented' two imaginary languages. The works of [[Candido Lopez]] (in [[Naïve art]] style), [[Emilio Pettoruti]] ([[cubist]]),  [[Antonio Berni]] ([[neo-figurative]] style), [[Fernando Fader]], are appreciated internationally.  

[[Benito Quinquela Martín]] is considered to be the quintesennial 'port' painter, to which the city of [[Buenos Aires]] and particularly the working class and immigrant-bound [[La Boca]] neighborhood, was excellently suited for. [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Leon Ferrari]] are acclaimed [[sculpture|scuptors]] and [[conceptual art|conceptual artists]].

===Food and drink===
[[Image:Asado argentino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Asado]]
[[Cuisine of Argentina|Argentine food]] is influenced by cuisine from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and other European countries, and many foods from those countries such as pasta, sausages, and desserts are common in the nation's diet. Argentina has a wide variety of staple foods, which include ''[[empanada]]s'', a stuffed pastry; ''[[locro]]'', a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd; and ''[[chorizo]]'', a meat-based spicy sausage. The Argentine barbecue, ''[[asado]]'', is one of the most famous in the world and includes various types of meats, among them ''chorizo'', [[sweetbread]], [[chitterlings]], and [[blood sausage]]. Being an important [[Argentine wine|wine]] producer, the yearly consumption is among the highest worldwide ([[Malbec]] has become a representative variety from Argentina). Also, a common custom among Argentines is drinking [[yerba Mate|mate]]. [[Dulce de Leche]] is a famous sweet caramel spread.

===Sports===
[[Image:La Bombonera.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The stadium for [[Boca Juniors]] football club, currently the team with the most international championships (16)]]
Argentina is a world power in [[team sports]]. [[Football in Argentina|Football]] ([[Football (soccer)|soccer]]) is the most popular [[sport in Argentina]], where it is twice [[FIFA World Cup]] Champions and one-time Olympic Gold medalists (also 14 time [[Copa América]] winners). Yet the national sport of the country is [[pato]], played with a six-handle ball on horseback. Also popular are [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]]; a number of basketball players participate in the NBA and European leagues, and the national team won Olypmpic Gold in the Athens Olympics. Argentina has one of the top ranking teams in [[Rugby union in Argentina|rugby union]]. Argentine [[tennis]] is very competitive on the world stage, with dozens of players male and female in active tour. Other popular sports include [[field hockey]] (the top female sport), [[golf]], and sailing. Argentina has a number of highly-ranked [[polo]] players and the national squad has historically been the world's strongest. [[Cricket]] and [[baseball]] are played in a limited fashion.<ref>[http://www.consumosculturales.gov.ar/ About the culture]</ref> 

[[Motorsports]] are well represented in Argentina, with [[Turismo Carretera]] and [[TC 2000]] the most popular car racing formats. People all over the country enjoy the races, but its most fervently followed in small towns and rural Argentina, attracting a rather similar demographic as [[NASCAR]] of the [[United States]]. The [[Rally Argentina]] is part of the [[World Rally Championship]] (currently held in Córdoba Province).

World famous Argentines in sport include [[football (soccer)|football]] superstar [[Diego Maradona]] and five time [[Formula 1]] champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]. Other great sporting figures are [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], [[Amadeo Carrizo]] and [[Gabriel Batistuta]] in [[football (soccer)]]; [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], and [[David Nalbandian]] in [[tennis]]; [[Roberto DeVicenzo]] and [[Ángel Cabrera]] for [[golf]]; [[Manu Ginobili]] and [[Andres Nocioni]] in [[basketball]]; [[Luciana Aymar]] in [[field hockey]]; [[Agustin Pichot]] in [[rugby union]], [[boxing|boxers]] [[Pascual Pérez (boxing)|Pascual Pérez]] and [[Carlos Monzón]]; the [[Heguy Family]] of [[Polo]] players, and many more.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Argentina}}

The major genres of popular music in Argentina are ''folclore'' ([[folk music]]), [[tango music|tango]], [[Argentine rock|rock]], ''tropical'' music ([[Argentine cumbia|cumbia]]), and [[dance music|dance]]-[[electronica]].

''Tango'', the music ''and'' lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called [[lunfardo]]), is Argentina's musical symbol. The [[Milonga]] dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into mordern ''tango''. By the 1930s, ''tango'' had changed from a dance focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers like [[Carlos Gardel]], [[Roberto Goyeneche]], [[Hugo del Carril]], [[Tita Merello]], and [[Edmundo Rivero]]. The golden age of ''tango'' (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of [[Jazz]] and [[Swing]] in the [[United States]], featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], [[Anibal Troilo]], [[Francisco Canaro]], and [[Juan D'Arienzo]]. After 1955 ''tango'' turned more intellectual and listener-oriented, led by [[Astor Piazzolla]]. Today tango has worldwide popularity, and the rise of ''neo-tango'' is a global phenomenon with groups like [[Tanghetto]], [[Bajofondo Tango Club|Bajofondo]] and [[Gotan Project]].

[[Argentine rock]] is the most popular music among youth. Arguably the most listened form of [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language rock, its influence and success internationally owes to a rich, uninterrupted evolution. Bands such as [[Soda Stereo]] or [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]], and composers like [[Charly García]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], and [[Fito Páez]] are referents of national culture. Mid 1960s [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Rosario]] were craddles of the music, and by 1970 argentine rock was established among middle class youth (see [[Almendra]], [[Sui Generis]], [[Pappo]], [[Crucis]]). [[Seru Giran]] bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere ([[Enanitos Verdes]], [[Fabulosos Cadillacs]], [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]], [[Andres Calamaro]]). There are many sub-genres: underground, pop oriented, and some associated with the working class ([[La Renga]], [[Attaque 77]], [[Divididos]], [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota|Los Redonditos]]). Current popular bands include: [[Babasonicos]], [[Rata Blanca]], [[El Otro Yo]], [[Attaque 77]], [[Bersuit]], [[Los Piojos]], [[Intoxicados]], and [[Miranda!]].

"Tropical" music, a mixture of [[cumbia]], local folk, and [[Caribbean]] syles, made it to Buenos Aires with South American migrants. This along with [[Cuarteto]] ([[Córdoba Province|Córdoba]], where artist [[La Mona Jiménez]] has inmense popularity) and [[chamamé]] ([[Corrientes]]), gave rise to [[cumbia villera]]. The preferred musical style in the [[villa miseria]] (slums), its lyrics can  parallel those of U.S. [[rap]] ([[poverty]], [[drugs]] and [[crime]]). Cumbia villera is increasingly accepted within the middle class, particularly bands with ties to [[football (soccer)|football]] idols (popular bands: ''Yerba Brava, Pibes Chorros, [http://www.gratisdamas.com.ar/ Damas Gratis], Nestor en Bloque''). [[Rodrigo Bueno]], simply known as ''Rodrigo'', was a surging [[cuarteto]] star until his untimely death in 2000.

[[Buenos Aires]] has a major [[techno]] and [[electronica]] scene in Latin America, hosting a variety of events like local raves, the South American Music Conference, and [[Creamfields]] (which has the world record of 65,000 people). European [[disk jockey|DJs]] tour Buenos Aires to perform at clubs or in festivals. The city has its own form of [[house music]], and is home to many successful electronic tango groups. Famous DJs from Argentina include [[Hernan Cattaneo]] and [[DJ Dero]]. [[Mar del Plata]] and [[Bariloche]] are other important dance and club-oriented cities.

[[European classical music]] is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the world-renowned [[Colón Theater]]. Classical musicians, such as [[Martha Argerich]], [[Lalo Schiffrin]], [[Daniel Barenboim]], Eduardo Alonso-Crespo, and classical composers like [[Alberto Ginastera]] are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras.

Argentine folk music is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. [[Juan Peron|Perón]]'s Argentina would give rise to [[nueva cancion|Nueva Canción]], as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], the greatest argentine [[folk musician]], and [[Mercedes Sosa]] would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in [[Chile]], where it took off in the 1970s and went on to influence the entirety of [[Latin America]]n music.<ref>[http://www.myfavouritemusic.info/tovar42303030303938594c50.html Music: 'El Derecho de vivir en paz'] from http://www.msu.edu/~chapmanb/jara/enueva.html</ref> Today, [[Chango Spasiuk]] and [[Soledad Pastorutti]] have brought folk back to younger generations. [[Leon Gieco]]'s ''folk-rock'' bridged the gap between [[music of Argentina|argentine folklore]]''and'' [[argentine rock]], introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.

Other notable musicians include [[Gato Barbieri]] with his seductive [[saxophone]] and [[free jazz]] compositions, and [[Jaime Torres]] and his spacious [[andean music]].

===Religion===
[[Image:Catedral de Córdoba, Argentina.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cathedral of Córdoba (Argentina)|Cathedral of Córdoba]] (dating back to the 17th century).]]
{{main|Religion in Argentina}}
Argentinians are predominantly religious. Around 80% declare themselves [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] according to different surveys, though most are not practising; the Church estimates an affiliation of 70%.<ref>Marita Carballo. ''Valores culturales al cambio del milenio'' (ISBN 950-794-064-2). [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/702434 Cited] in [[La Nación]], [[8 May]] 2005.</ref><ref>U.S. Department of State. [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71446.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006].</ref>
Catholicism is supported by the state and endorsed in the [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution]]. [[Protestantism|Evangelical]] churches have gained a foothold in Argentina since the 1980s, and their followers now number more than 3.5 million, about 10% of the total population. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) number over 330,300, the seventh-largest concentration in the world.<ref>[http://www.lds.org.ar/noticias2005/noti_ene2005/info_noti_ene2005_05.htm Number of Mormons in Argentina]</ref>
Traditional [[Protestant]] communities are also present.

The country also hosts the largest [[Judaism|Jewish]] population in [[Latin America]], about 2 percent of the population.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ar.html#People Number of Jews in Argentina]</ref>
It is also home to one of the largest [[mosque]]s in Latin America, serving Argentina's [[Islam|Muslim]] community, estimated at 500,000–600,000 (93% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]).

{{seealso|State-Church relations in Argentina}}

===Language===
[[Image:Cartelvosbsas.JPG|thumb|right|180px|A film poster in Buenos Aires. The title exemplifies the phenomenon of ''[[voseo]]''.]]

The only national official language of Argentina is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (which the Argentines call "Castellano" or [[Castilian]]), though the Amerindian language [[Guaraní]] also holds official status in the province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]]. [[Quechua]] is spoken in [[Santiago del Estero]] province.

Some immigrants and indigenous communities have retained their [[List of Native American languages in Argentina|original languages]]. For example, Patagonia has many [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking towns, and there are a number of [[German language|German]]-speaking neighborhoods in Córdoba, Entre Ríos, Buenos Aires and again in Patagonia. Italian, English and French are widely spoken, and other languages such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Russian are easily found in Buenos Aires. [[Aymara language|Aymara]] is spoken by members of the Bolivian community who migrated to Argentina from remote rural areas in [[Bolivia]].

Argentines are the only large [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking society that universally employ what is known as ''[[voseo]]'' (the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'', which occasions the use of alternate verb forms as well). The most prevalent dialect is [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]], whose speakers are primarily located in the basin of the [[Río de la Plata]].

A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of [[CONICET]] and the University of Toronto showed that the accent of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires (known as [[Porteño]]s) is closer to the Neapolitan dialect of Italian than any other spoken language.  This immigration of Italians had a profound influence on [[Lunfardo]], the famous slang spoken in Buenos Aires and elsewhere in the Río de la Plata region, permeating the  vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.

{{seealso|List of indigenous languages in Argentina}}

===Education===
After independence, Argentina rapidly constructed a national [[public education]] system in comparison to other nations, placing the country high up in the rankings of global [[literacy]]. Today the country has a literacy rate of 97.5%, comparable to developed nations. 
[[Image:Delantales blancos 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children; it is a national symbol of learning]]

School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. The Argentine school system consists of a primary or lower school level lasting six or seven years, and a secondary or high school level of between 3-5 years. In the 1990s, the system was split into different types of high school instruction, called ''Educacion Secundaria'' and the ''Polimodal''. Some provinces adopted the ''Polimodal'' while others did not. There is a project in the Executive to repeal this measure and return to a more classic secondary level system of five years.<ref> [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/07/20/sociedad/s-03901.htm La Iglesia salió a defender la ley de Educación que el Gobierno quiere modificar] Clarin.com Jul 20, 2006 (Spanish)</ref> President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] is overwhelmingly credited in pushing and implementing a free, modern education system in Argentina.

Education is free at all levels except for [[graduate studies]]. There are many private school institutions in the primary, secondary and university levels. Around 11.1 million people were enrolled in formal education of some kind:

* 9,551,728 people attended either kindergarten, primary (lower school), or secondary (high school) establishements
* 494,461 people attended non-university level establishements (such as training or technical schools)
* 1,125,257 people attended colleges or universities<ref> [http://www.indec.gov.ar INDEC] 2001 Census Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos (Spanish)</ref>

There are 35 public [[universities]] across the Argentine Republic. The Universities of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, La Plata, UTN (Technology University) , and Cuyo (Mendoza), are among the most important. Terciary (university) attendance is very high for global standards. Public universities faced cutbacks in spending during the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a decline in overall quality.

===Holidays===
{{main|Public holidays in Argentina}}
Public holidays include most of the Catholic holidays, though holidays of other faiths are respected. The main historic holidays include the anniversaries of the [[May Revolution]] (May 25), the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Independence Day]] (July 9), [[Flag of Argentina|National Flag]] day (June 20), and the death of national hero [[José de San Martín]] (August 17).

==Science and technology==
Argentina has contributed to the world many distinguished doctors, scientists, and inventors.
[[Image:Luis Federico Leloir - young.jpg|thumb|right|Luis Federico Leloir won the [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry in 1970]]
Argentines have been responsible for major breakthroughs in world [[medicine]]. [[René Favaloro]] developed the tecniques and performed the world's first ever coronary [[bypass surgery]], and [[Francisco de Pedro]] invented a more reliable artificial [[cardiac pacemaker]]. [[Bernardo Houssay]] discovered the role of [[pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] in regulating [[glucose]] in animals; [[César Milstein]] did extensive research in [[antibody|antibodies]]; [[Luis Leloir]] discovered how organisms store energy coverting glucose into [[glycogen]], and the compounds which are fundamental in [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[carbohydrate]]s. [[Luis Agote]] performed one of the first two [[blood transfusion]]s with pre-stored blood in history. [[Enrique Finochietto]] designed operating table tools such as the surgical scissors that bear his name ("Finochietto scissors"), and a rib-spreader.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/372127 Enrique Finochietto]</ref> [[Roberto Zaldivar|Roberto Zaldívar]] is a pioneer in laser-eye procedures and research. Argentine research has led to advancement in wound-healing therapies, [[heart disease]], and in several forms of [[cancer]].

Argentina's [[Nuclear power|nuclear program]] is highly advanced. Argentina developed its nuclear program without being overly dependent on foreign technology. Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in [[Peru]], [[Algeria]], [[Australia]], and [[Egypt]]. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s. Since then Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.<ref>[http://www.ceip.org/programs/npp/nppargn.htm Argentina] Non-Proliferation</ref>

In other areas, [[Juan Vucetich]] is the father of modern dactiloscopy<ref>Julia Rodríguez, Columbia University. [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/diaspora/sympapers.htm The Argentine Fingerprint System].</ref> (see [[fingerprint]]), Raúl Pateras de Pescara demonstrated the world's first flight of a [[helicopter]], Hungarian-Argentine [[László Bíró]] mass-produced the first modern [[ball point pen]]s, and Eduardo Taurozzi developed the more efficient pendular combustion engine.<ref>[http://www.argentinaahora.com/extranjero/ingles/bot_servicios/infoutil/infonews_.asp?id_noticia=930 Argentine Talent Without Frontiers]</ref> [[Juan Maldacena]] is a leading figure in [[quantum theory]].

==Communications==
===Print===
The printed media in Argentina is highly developed and independent. There are over 200 [[newspapers]] in the country, influencial in their home cities and regions. The major national newspapers are from Buenos Aires, including the centrist [[Clarín (newspaper)|Clarín]], the best selling daily in the Spanish speaking world. Other national papers are [[La Nación]] (center-right), [[Página/12]] (center-left), [[Ámbito Financiero]] (business conservative), Argentinisches Tagleblatt in German, Le Monde Diplomatique in Spanish and French and [[Crónica (newspaper)|Crónica]] (populist). Regional papers of importance include [[La Capital]] ([[Rosario]]), [[Los Andes (newspaper)|Los Andes]] ([[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]), [[La Voz del Interior]] ([[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]]), and [[El Tribuno]] ([[Salta]]).  The [[Buenos Aires Herald]] is a well-respected English language daily. 

The Argentine [[publishing]] industry is with those in [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]] the most important in the Spanish-speaking world.  Argentina features the largest [[bookstore]] chains in Latin America, the ''[[El Ateneo]]'' and ''[[Yenny (bookstore)|Yenny]]'' bookstores; numerous well-stocked independent stores abound.  A number carry titles in English and other languages.  There are hundreds of [[magazine]] publications covering a plethora of issues and hobbies, which are sold in kiosks on city sidewalks and in bookstores.

===Radio and television===
Argentina was a pioneering nation in [[radio]] broadcasting. At 9 PM on [[August 27]], [[1920]], ''Sociedad Radio Argentina'' announced: ''"We now bring to your homes a live performance of [[Richard Wagner]]'s Parsifal opera from the [[Coliseo Theater]] in downtown Buenos Aires"''; only about twenty homes in the city had a receiver to tune in. The world's first radio station was the only one in the country until 1922, when ''Radio Cultura'' went on the air. By 1925, there were twelve stations in Buenos Aires and ten in other cities. The 1930s were the "golden age" of radio in Argentina, with live variety, news, soap opera, and sport shows.<ref>[http://www.swl.net/patepluma/south/misc/argendx.html Radio With a Past in Argentina] Don Moore</ref>

At present there are more than 1,500 radio stations licensed in Argentina; 260 are [[AM broadcasting]] and 1150 [[FM broadcasting]].{{citation needed}} Radio remains an important medium in Argentina. Music and youth variety programs dominate FM formats; news, debate, and sports are AM radio's primary broadcasts. [[Amateur radio]] is widespread in the country. Radio still serves a vital service of information, entertainment and even life saving in the most remote communities.

The Argentine [[television]] industry is large and diverse, widely viewed in Latin America, and its productions seen around the world.  Many local programs are broadcast by networks in other countries, and others have their rights purchased by foreign producers for adaptations in their own markets. Argentina has five major networks (in order of ratings: [[Telefé]], [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|Canal 13]], [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]], [[América 2]], and [[Canal 7 Argentina]]). All provincial capitals and other large cities have at least one local station.  Argentina boasts the highest penetration of cable and satellite television in Latin America, similar to percentages in [[North America]].<ref>[http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/tilan/statistics/cable_table.html Homes with Cable TV in Latin America] Trends in Latin American networking</ref>  Many cable networks operate from Argentina and serve the Spanish-speaking world, including [[Utilísima Satelital]], [[Torneos y Competencias|TyC Sports]], [[Fox Sports en Español]] (with the United States and México), MTV Argentina, Cosmopolitan TV, and the news network Todo Noticias.
