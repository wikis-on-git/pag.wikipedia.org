History of PIDEG as one Baranggay in Tubao La Union
Before the Spanish
Before the province of La Union was established, Pideg was part of Tubao, La Union, and was a settlement of people of the "same race as those of Pangasinan." (de Loarca,1582) These people traded with Chinese merchants long before Columbus even sailed to the new world. Later, the Japanese came and established their first settlement in the Philippines. At this time, Pideg's coast was shaped in such a way that it was a good harbor for foreign vessels coming into Lingayen Gulf. Miguel De Loarca referred to Pideg as “El Puerto de Japon” - the Japanese Port.
On March 2, 1850, the province of La Union was created by Governor–General Antonio Maria Blanco. It comprised the northwestern towns of Pangasinan and the towns of Ilocos Sur south of the Amburayan river. Pideg was the oldest baranggay to be integrated and was listed as having a population of 6,936 people.
	There are 8 purok’s in the baranggay comprises with the purok’s captains.
