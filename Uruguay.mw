'''Uruguay''', officially the '''Eastern Republic of Uruguay''' or the '''Republic East of the Uruguay (River)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''República Oriental del Uruguay''; [[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[re'puβ̞lika oɾjen'tal del uɾu'ɰwaj]}}), is a country located in southern [[South America]]. It is bordered by [[Brazil]] to the north, the [[Uruguay River]] to the west, the [[estuary]] of the [[Río de la Plata]] (literally "River of Silver", but commonly known in English as "River Plate") to the southwest, with [[Argentina]] on the other bank of both, and finally the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast. About half of its people live in the capital and largest city, [[Montevideo]]. The nation is the second smallest independent country in South America, larger only than [[Suriname]] (it is also larger than [[French Guiana]], which is not independent), and is one of the most politically and economically stable.

[[Image:Toortse Rio de la Plata.png|thumb|left|200px|Rio de la Plata in 1603]]
The name "Uruguay" comes from [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], the original language of the native people of the region. It has many possible meanings since Guaraní is a highly [[agglutinative]] language. Two of them are "river of the urus" (uru is a kind of bird) and "river of colorful or 'painted' birds."

''Main article: [[Geography of Uruguay]]''

At 176.215 [[square kilometre]]s, Uruguay is the second smallest country in [[South America]], after [[Suriname]]. The landscape features mostly rolling plains and low hill ranges (''cuchillas'') with a fertile coastal lowland, most of it grassland, ideal for [[cattle]] and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] raising. The highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral at 514 metres (1,686&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). To the southwest is the [[Río de la Plata]] (River of Silver), the estuary of the [[Uruguay River]], which forms the western border, and the [[Paraná River]], that does not run through Uruguay itself. The only other major river is the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]]. Several lagoons are found along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.

The [[climate]] in Uruguay is [[temperate climate|temperate]], but fairly warm, as freezing temperatures are almost unknown. The predominantly flat landscape is also somewhat vulnerable to rapid changes from weather fronts, as well as to the [[pampero]], a chilly and occasionally violent wind blowing north from the [[pampa]]s plains in [[Argentina]].

=== Enclaves and exclaves ===
There is one Argentine [[enclave]] within Uruguayan territory: the island of [[Martín García]] (coordinates {{coor dm|34|11|S|58|15|W}}). It is situated near the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, a mere kilometre (1,100&nbsp;[[yard|yd]]) inside Uruguayan waters, about 3.5 kilometres (2.2&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) from the Uruguayan coastline, near the small city of [[Martín Chico]] (itself about halfway between [[Nueva Palmira]] and [[Colonia]]).

An agreement reached by Argentina and Uruguay in [[1973]] reaffirmed Argentine jurisdiction over the island, ending a century-old dispute between the two countries.{{Fact}} According to the terms of the agreement, Martín García is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve. Its area is about 2 square kilometres (500&nbsp;[[acres]]), and the population about 200 persons. In addition, Gloria Recoda has exclusive land rights on a quarter of the island.

== Economy ==
:''Main article: [[Economy of Uruguay]]''
[[Image:Playa Pocitos.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Montevideo]], Uruguay's capital]]
Uruguay's economy is characterised by an export-oriented [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, a well-educated workforce, and high levels of social spending, as well as a developed industrial sector. After averaging growth of 5% annually in [[1996]]-[[1998]], in [[1999]]-[[2001]] the economy suffered from lower demand in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], which together account for nearly half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating &mdash; one of only two in South America.{{Fact}} In recent years Uruguay has shifted most of its energy into developing the commercial use of IT technologies and has become an important exporter of software in Latin America{{Fact}}.

While some parts of the economy appeared to be resilient, the downturn had a far more severe impact on Uruguayan citizens, as unemployment levels rose to more than twenty percent, [[real wage]]s fell, the [[Uruguayan peso|peso]] was devalued, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty reached almost 40%. These worsening economic conditions played a part in turning public opinion against the [[free market]] economic policies adopted by the previous administrations in the 1990s, leading to popular rejection of proposals for [[privatization]] of the state petroleum company in 2003 and of the state water company in 2004. The newly elected [[Frente Amplio]] government, while pledging to continue payments on Uruguay's external debt,{{Fact}} has also promised to undertake a crash jobs programs to attack the widespread problems of poverty and unemployment.{{Fact}}

== Agriculture ==
:''Main article: [[Agriculture of Uruguay]]''
Agriculture played such an important part in Uruguayan history and national identity until the middle of the 20th century that the entire country was then sometimes likened to a single huge estancia (agricultural estate) with Montevideo, where the wealth generated in the hinterland was spent, as its ''casco'' or administrative head. As another saying went, "''Uruguay es la vaca y el puerto''" ("Uruguay is the cow and the port").{{Fact}} When world market prices for Uruguay’s main export commodities like beef and wool fell drastically in the 1950s, the country's prosperous golden era came to an end.

[[Image: Estanciahistorica-florida-uruguay.jpg|thumb|280px|A heartland of historic estancias : Estancia San Eugenio, Casupá, southern department of Florida]]Today, agriculture still contributes roughly 10% to the country’s GDP and is the main foreign exchange earner, putting Uruguay in line with other agricultural exporters like Brazil, Canada and New Zealand. Uruguay is a member of the [[Cairns Group]] of exporters of agricultural products. Uruguay’s agriculture has relatively low inputs of labour, technology and capital in comparison with other such countries, which results in comparatively lower yields per hectare but also open the door for Uruguay to market its products as "natural" or "ecological."

Campaigns like “Uruguayan grass-fed beef” and “Uruguay Natural” aim to establish Uruguay as a premium brand in beef, wine and other food products.{{Fact}}

Recently, an industry has arisen around [[agritourism|estancia tourism]] that capitalizes on the traditional or folkloristic connotations associated with gaucho culture and the remaining resources of the historic [[hacienda|estancias]] of Uruguay's golden era.

== Demographics ==
:''Main article: [[Demographics of Uruguay]]''

[[Image:Torreantel.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Torre de las Telecomunicaciones ([[Torre Antel|Antel Tower]]) in Montevideo.]]

Like the neighbouring nation of [[Argentina]], Uruguay was heavily populated by people of European origin. Some 84% of the population is [[white]] [[European]] descent almost evenly split amongst [[Italians]], and [[Spaniards]], with smaller [[German]], [[Irish]], [[Scandinavian]], and [[Armenian]] communities. [[Mestizo]]s (mixed European and Amerindian) constitute the second largest group (11%) and Afro-Uruguayan, and mixed race (5%) forming the only significant ethnic minorities. Church and state are officially separated. Most Uruguayans adhere to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith (66%), with smaller [[Protestant]] (2%) and [[Jewish]] and Armenian Christian (1%) communities, as well as a large nonprofessing group (31%). [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uy.html#People]

Uruguay is distinguished by its high [[literacy]] rate (97%), large urban middle class, and relatively even income distribution. During the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated 600,000 Uruguayans emigrated, principally to [[Spain]]. [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]. Other Uruguayans went to various countries in [[Europe]] and [[USA]]. 

As a result of the low birth rate, high [[life expectancy]], and relatively high rate of emigration of younger people, Uruguay's population is quite mature. In 2006 the country had a birth rate of 13.91 births per thousand population,[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/uy.html#People] lower than neighboring countries [[Argentina]] (16.73 births/1000 population)[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ar.html#People] and [[Brazil]] (16.56 births/1,000 population).[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/br.html#People]
