==Historiya==
The town had its humble beginnings in 1770 as a farming village when it was founded by Don Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes and named it Barrio Del Pilar. It was in a productive agricultural area between the towns of [[San Luis, Pampanga|San Luis]] in the North and [[Apalit, Pampanga|Apalit]] in the South. As the population kept on growing in the local community, the leading citizens of the progressive village initiated a petition to consolidate a portion of the southern part of the town of San Luis and a land area from the northern part of the municipality of Apalit to form an independent municipality.

Appraised of the economic potential of a new town and confidence in the management capability of the leaders, the Spanish [[Gobernador-Heneral|Governor General]] at the time during his second term as chief administrator of the Philippines, Don [[Simón de Anda y Salazar]] approved the official creation of the town on November 15, 1771.

The town was named in honor of the Spanish Governor General who approved its creation and of the Apostle [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]], the [[Patron santo|Patron Saint]] of the illustrious town of Apalit. Like any other typical Spanish town (pueblo) it was administered by a “Capitan del Pueblo” and had a municipal policy making body called today as Municipal Council. The Catholic Parish Church, the Public Market, the Town Plaza and homes of prominent families were located within the proximity of the Municipal Hall. The people of San Simon celebrate two town fiestas, one in honor of Lady of the Pillar, the patron saint of the first barrio and the other in honor of the Apostle Simon Peter. In 1898, the retreating military forces of General Antonio Luna on their way to Nueva Ecija burned the parish church. 

Among the early settlers of the town were the de los Reyes, de los Santos, Macapagal, Pangan, Punzalan, Puyat, Santos and Simbulan families.

In 1904, the town of San Simon was merged with the municipality of San Luis and about three years after, it became again an independent municipality. In 1920, the geographical boundaries of San Luis, Apalit and San Simon were officially established.

In 1979, through the effort and financial contributions of the Ibanez, Guevarra, Santos, Punsalan, Pangan and other families, the church was rebuilt and named as Nuestra Senora Del Pilar.

==Saray politika tan gobiyerno==

Like other towns in the Philippines, San Simon is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios.

=== [[:en:Local government in the Philippines|Municipal Government]] ===

Just as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the [[Korte Suprema diad Pilipino|Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.

The executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.[http://www.dilg.gov.ph/pdf/LGC%20Book%203.pdf Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III], [[Kagawaran na Interiyor tan Lokal ya Gobiyerno|Department of Interior and Local Government]] official website. The legislative branch is composed of  the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] for the youth sector.

The seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.

==Ekonomiya==

The principal industries in San Simon are farming, fishing and poultry and swine industries. There are two public markets in San Simon, one in the old poblacion area and another one located in the industrial zone area.

Following the advancement of technology and industrialization, the climate for investment in San Simon is very promising because of its geographic location and the incentives initiated by Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc and the Municipal Council presided then by Vice Mayor Azor L. Sitchon. Through their effort and efficient leadership, the town with an annual gross income of about 500,000.00 Philippine pesos in 1988 as a 6th class municipality became a 4th class municipality with an annual gross income of more than 3,500,000 Philippine pesos by the end of the 20th century. When Mayor Azor L. Sitchon, an Economics graduate with honors from the famed Ateneo de Manila University took over the administration as elected mayor, he not only continued the completion of the projects and programs of his predecessor, Mayor Manuel S. Bondoc but he also initiated his own new economic programs and infrastructure projects including a modern public market and a new Municipal Hall along the national highway in barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) and made it centrally accessible from all directions. Barrio San Agustin (Tulauc) became a commercial center and the seat of municipal government, thus contributing to the increase of municipal tax revenues. Total target tax revenues from business taxes, real property taxes and other fees were projected to be more than 7,000,000.00 Philippine pesos. It is acknowledged that the significant economic growth in San Simon was brought about by the Comprehensive Municipal Development and Land Use Plan enacted by the Municipal Council. The [[Zoning|zoning ordinance]] reclassified the entire stretch of Quezon Road as Industrial and Commercial Zone, but limited only to light and medium size industries and those that are environmental friendly.

Another factor that contributes to the potential economic growth of San Simon in the 21st century is its geographic location. It is strategically located in the central part of the “W” Growth Corridor of Central Luzon and it is accessible from major road networks and arteries coming from the different provinces of Central Luzon and Metro Manila. From the North Luzon Expressway, one can take an exit through the San Simon Toll Plaza, which is about 45 kilometers from Metro Manila and seven kilometers from San Fernando City, Pampanga and approximately 20 kilometers from the Clark Special Economic Zone in Angeles. City.

Taking advantage of the conducive local business environment, [[Tax exemption|tax incentives]] and availability of skilled workers, many manufacturing and commercial firms have been established or relocated in San Simon. The infusion of private capital investment was about ten billion pesos and expected to increase to more than twenty billion pesos by the early years of the 21st century.
