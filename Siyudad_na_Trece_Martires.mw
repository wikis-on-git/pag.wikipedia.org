==Historiya==
Trece Martires started as one of the largest and remotest barrios in Cavite.  It was originally named ''Quinta'' or ''Quintana'' and was part of the municipality of Tanza, Cavite.  The land was basically agricultural subdivided into cattle ranches and sugar farms, with less than one thousand hectares, located at the intersection of the Tanza-Indang Road and the present Naic-Dasmariñas Road in the province.<ref name="Cavite">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=158 "Trece Martires City - Brief History"]. Cavite Provicial Website. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref><ref name="RA981"/>

The city was established on May 24, 1954 under Republic Act No. 981 entitled "The Charter of Trece Martires City" as approved by President [[Ramón Magsaysay]].  The Republic Act also transferred the capital of the province from [[Cavite City]] to Trece Martires.<ref name="RA981">{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra981-city-charter-of-trece-martires.html|title=An Act Establishing the New Capital of the Province of Cavite, and Providing a Charter Therefor, and for Other Purposes|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>   The original bill, House Bill 1795, was authored by Congressman Jose T. Cajulis (1954–1957) and Senator Justiniano S. Montano (1949–1956).

Under the city charter, the Governor of the province is the ex-officio city mayor of Trece Martires City thus making then Governor Dominador Mangubat as the city's first chief executive.  On January 2, 1956, the provincial capitol was formally inaugurated, the same day the newly-elected governor, Delfin N. Montano, the son of Senator Justiniano Montano, was sworn into office.  He served as governor and mayor of Trece Martires from 1956 to 1971.<ref name="Cavite"/>

On June 22, 1957 the original act was amended by Republic Act 1912 increasing its territory to 3917 hectares, more or less. Consequently, the municipalities of Indang and General Trias had to yield parts of their respective areas to this territorial expansion.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno1912.html "Republic Act No. 1912"]. Chan Robles Virtual Law Library. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>

Former President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed Presidential Decree No. 1163 relocating the capital and seat of government from Trece Martires to [[Imus City]].  Governor [[Juanito Victor C. Remulla]] requested Marcos in September 1979 to transfer the capital back to Trece Martires City.  As of 2012, 
the provincial capital is still [[Imus, Cavite|Imus City]], but most of the provincial offices are still located in Trece Martires City.<ref>[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=269&Itemid=95 "Quick Facts"].

On March 31, [[1992]], the Republic Act no. 7325 was approved by President [[Corazon Aquino]] amending the charter of Trece Martires City, allowing the city to vote their own local officials for the first time.<ref>[http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/ra7325.html "Republic Act No. 7325"].
