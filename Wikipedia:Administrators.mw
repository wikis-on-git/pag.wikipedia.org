An '''administrator''' is also called a ''sysop''. You can add requests to this page for things that can only be done by sysops.

If you want a page deleted, say so on the [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletions]] page.

Sysops are allowed to do some things that other users are not. This is for performance reasons (it would make the website too slow to let everyone do it). It is also for security reasons (because they are trusted). If you want to become one, please say so on this page.

Anyone who has been adding to this website for a while is allowed to be an administrator. Jimbo Wales, the founder of the [[Wikimedia|Wikimedia Foundation]], said "this should be no big deal".

Sysops do not have any special authority. They are equal to everybody else.

Things administrators can do:
* Delete pages - [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy]], [[Wikipedia:Requests for deletion]]
* Protect and unprotect pages, and edit protected pages - [[Wikipedia:Protection policy]]
* Stop users who damage pages - [[Wikipedia:Bans and blocks]], [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]]

----
A '''bureaucrat''' is a slightly higher administrative level that can perform a few additional functions. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat status to other users following a successful request on this page. Bureaucrats can also help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change user names]]. They can also "flag" [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Requests for name changes should be made directly to the talk page of one of the listed bureaucrats.

Users can contact sysops on this page to ask them to protect pages. Requests for deletion should be made on [[Wikipedia:Requests for deletion]] and requests for blocking on [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]].

All sysops should watch this section for issues that sysops must be aware of, and for news about policy changes affecting sysops.
