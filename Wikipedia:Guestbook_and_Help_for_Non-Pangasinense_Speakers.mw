Have you ever fantasized about how your girlfriend or wife would look in certain types of sexy lingerie? Many guys have fantasies about women in certain types of lingerie and wished that their partners would wear more sexy lingerie instead of the plain looking lingerie that you get from regular lingerie stores. However, going to a lingerie store can be a dreadful and embarrassing experience for a guy. Can you imagine yourself being followed around by the sales assistant at the lingerie store or the stares that you get if you choose something a little daring, flamboyant or sexy? Not to mention the overwhelming number of choices, colors and sizes available that would confuse you. On top of that, there is also the hassle of driving to the store, looking for parking and being surrounded by crowds of watchful people at a sale. 
 
When a guy walks into a sexy lingerie store, very often he will become more self-conscious and worry about what others may think. Some guys will blush or feel their heartbeat increase when they go to a sexy lingerie store. Why put yourself through such stress and feelings of anxiety? Shopping for lingerie is supposed to be fun!
