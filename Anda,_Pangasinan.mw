==Economy==

The town thrives on [[farming]] and deep-sea [[fishing]].

In the past, progress in the town was sluggish due to its dependence to a landing barge to cross the Catubig Channel separating Anda to mainland Bolinao. In 1992, trade has increased due to a bridge connecting the municipality to the  mainland. This bridge, known  as Anda Bridge, was sponsored and inaugurated by then President Fidel V. Ramos, who hails from Pangasinan province. Main roads have been concreted for faster access to the barangays, especially tourism related places.
