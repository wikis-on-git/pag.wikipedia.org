The name "Bulakan" is derived from the Tagalog word "bulak", which means "cotton". The Spaniards named the town Bulacan due to the abundance of cotton plants growing in the region. The town is one of the oldest in the country. The Augustinians founded the town in 1572 and dedicated it under the patronage of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in 1578. According to local, records Father Agustin del Alburqueque, OSA is the first priest and founder of the town of Bulakan.

Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, Bulakan, as well as the rest of the towns of Bulacan province was consisted of small scattered settlements of villages each then called "balangay" or "barangay" a word derived from the name of the boats used by the early seafaring Malays who went to various islands of what now called Philippines. The villages and barangays were headed by a petty chieftain who bore the title of "Gat" or "Lakan". These early settlers lived along the seashores and rivers, thus they were called "taga-ilog", meaning people who dwell near the rivers or other waterways. From this term "taga-ilog" came the word "Tagalog".

By the year 1591 the town of Bulakan had 1,200 tributes or 4,800 persons, one Augustinian convent and one Alcalde mayor who had jurisdiction over the town of Malolos (Become independent in 1673) Balagtas formerly "Bigaa" (become separate town in 1596), Guiguinto (become separate town in 1915). In the heart of the town stands the centuries old adobe church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in front of it, stand the municipal hall and the park dedicated to Gregorio del Pilar.

The Parish of Nuestra Señora dela Asuncion, the "oldest Roman Catholic church in the province", has a baptismal book entry as early as 1578, it was precious artifact for almost 400 years it was not destroyed by fire or war. On the first page of the book, written was the name of the barrio of the town of Bulakan, Bagio, Bulakan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Matungao, Cupang, Banban, Dapdap, Parian, Balubad, Pitpitan, Maysantor, Acsajo, Paniqui, San Nicolas, Nagdasig, Calungusan, Taliktik and Sta Ana.

After 400 long years, changes have been made to the old barrios that consist the town, Bagio become part of Bagumbayan in 1731, Tibig exist in 1735, Dapdap was renamed Sta. Ana in 1741, Nagdasig become part of Tab-Ang in 1744 and now San Francisco, Parian was renamed Sta. Inez in 1765, Bulakan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Paniqui and Calungusan was created into one barrio and was named San Jose, Barrio Pitpitan occupied Acsajo, Cupang was joined to Maysantor now Maysantol, Banban became Bangbang and now Bambang, Perez exist as separate Barrio of Taliktik now Taliptip, and with the same old name of Barrio's San Nicolas, Matungao and Balubad.

The early Bulakenyos were engaged in farming, fishing and handicrafts, especially weaving.

The town of Bulacan, being the first capital of the province, was the hub of economic activities and the inhabitants enjoyed excellent trade with Manila, primarily due to its proximity to the city and accessibility through its wide and navigable river. 

Bulakan was also the scene of battle between the Spaniards led by Simón de Anda y Salazar and the British led by Captain Slay on during the short British occupation of Manila. The British sent an expedition of 400 British, 300 Malabar Negroes and 2,000 Chinese allies. The Spaniards with the native of Bulakan made a gallant stand but were defeated. Captain Slay eventually took over the town but did not last long. A huge group of about 8000 Filipino guerillas led by Spanish Jose Pedro Busto made a nine long days battle in front of the church up to the foot bridge against Captain Slay. They made Captain Slay to retreat to Manila. On this fight Bulakeños have shown for the first time an extraordinary martyrdom. The British attempt of conquering the rest of the country was gone astray because of the marvelous fight made by Bulakeños.

The town still enjoys trade and commerce with the neighboring towns and Manila with whom she shares a coastline, a place that is replete with historical and glorious past.
