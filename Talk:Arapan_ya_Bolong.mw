SysOp note: [[MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning]] contains <nowiki><strong></nowiki> two times. The last should be <nowiki></strong></nowiki>! That will fix that bold font on edits ;-) --- Best regards, [[User:MelancholieBot|MelancholieBot]] 11:02, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

== Small request ==

Hello! I am a Polish wikipedian and I would like to ask you for your help - writing a new article about former Polish President who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 – '''Lech Wałęsa'''. I have looked for his biography in your Wikipedia but without success. Polish Wikipedians will be grateful for your help. Thank you so much in advance! PS you can find the English version of the article '''[[w:en:Lech Wałęsa|here]]'''. Best wishes from Poland, [[User:Patrol110|Patrol110]] 22:04, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
