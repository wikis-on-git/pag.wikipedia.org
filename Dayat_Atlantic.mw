[[Image:Atlantic_Ocean.png|right|Atlantic Ocean]]

The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second-largest [[ocean]], covering approximately one-fifth of the [[Earth]]'s surface. The ocean's name, derived from [[Greek mythology]], means the "[[Sea]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]." The oldest known mention of this [[name]] is contained in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (I 202).

This ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending in a north-south direction and is divided into the North Atlantic and South Atlantic by [[Equatorial Counter Current]]s at about 8° North [[latitude]]. Bounded by the [[Americas]] on the west and [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] on the east, the Atlantic is linked to the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Arctic Ocean]] on the north and the [[Drake Passage]] on the south. A man-made connection between the Atlantic and Pacific is provided by the [[Panama Canal]].  On the east, the dividing line between the Atlantic and the [[Indian Ocean]] is the 20° East meridian, running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]].  The Atlantic is separated from the Arctic by a line from [[Greenland]] to northwestern [[Iceland]] and then from northeastern Iceland to the southernmost tip of [[Spitsbergen]] and then to [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] in northern [[Norway]].<ref>[http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/03_GeopolOc/s23_1953.pdf ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''].  International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.</ref>

Covering approximately 20% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic Ocean is second only to the Pacific in size. With its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about [[1 E14 m²|106,400,000]]&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (41,100,000&nbsp;[[square mile|sq mi]]); without them, it has an area of [[1 E13 m²|82,400,000 square kilometres]] (31,800,000&nbsp;sq mi). The land area that drains into the Atlantic is four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic Ocean with its adjacent seas is [[1 E15 m³|354,700,000]]&nbsp;[[cubic kilometre]]s (85,100,000&nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&nbsp;cu mi).

The average depths of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is 3,338 [[metre]]s (10,932 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]); without them it is 3,926 metres (12,881 ft).  The greatest depth, 8,605 metres (28,232 ft), is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The width of the Atlantic varies from [[1 E6 m|2,848]] [[kilometre]]s (1,770 mi) between [[Brazil]] and [[Liberia]] to about [[1 E6 m|4,830 kilometres]] (3,000 mi) between the [[United States]] and northern Africa.

==Ocean bottom==
The principal feature of the bottom [[topography]] of the Atlantic Ocean is a submarine mountain range called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. It extends from Iceland in the north to approximately 58° South latitude, reaching a maximum width of about 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi). A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water over the ridge is less than 2,700 m (8,900 ft) in most places, and several mountain peaks rise above the water and form islands. The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths averaging between 3,700 and 5,500 metres (12,000 and 18,000 ft). Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat, although numerous [[seamount]]s and some [[guyot]]s exist. Several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor. The Puerto Rico Trench, in the North Atlantic, is the deepest. The [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]. In the South Atlantic, the [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of 8,428 metres (27,651 ft). A third major trench, the [[Romanche Trench]], is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about 7,454 metres (24,455 ft). The shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography. Several deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of terrigenous, pelagic, and authigenic material. Terrigenous deposits consist of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts. Pelagic deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerinida|Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from 60 to 3,300 metres (200 to 11,000 ft), they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling. Authigenic deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where [[sediment]]ation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits.

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest of the world's major oceans; the [[salinity]] of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season.  Surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and melting of [[sea ice]].  Although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south of the equator, in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.  

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from less than −2&nbsp;°[[Celsius]] to 29&nbsp;°C (28&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 84&nbsp;°F). <!-- less than 2 is not −2, but assuming less than -2 intended, degree signs butt to letter with space from number --> Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7&nbsp;°C to 8&nbsp;°C (44°F to 46°F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). The North Atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as 4,000 metres (13,200 ft). The Antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres (13,200 ft).

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the [[Sargasso Sea]], in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average.  The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for the [[European eel]].

Because of the [[Coriolis effect]], water in the North Atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction, whereas water circulation in the South Atlantic is counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-[[diel|diurnal]]; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. The tides are a general wave that moves from south to north. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[Image:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|frame|right|Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.]]

The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the ocean's great capacity for retaining heat, maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures. The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest climatic zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in the high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. Adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents. The [[Gulf Stream]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and northwestern Europe, and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks]] area) and the northwestern coast of Africa. In general, winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world's oceans, after the [[Southern Ocean]]. Evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to 180 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent, [[Pangaea]], were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores. The [[Vikings]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Christopher Columbus]] were the most famous among its early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the Americas (known as [[transatlantic]] trade). Numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken, including those by the German Meteor expedition, [[Columbia University]]'s Lamont Geological Observatory, and the [[United States Navy]] [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]].

Some important events in relation to the Atlantic:
*In 1858, the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid by [[Cyrus Field]].
*On [[April 14th 1912]] the [[RMS Titanic]] sank after hitting an iceberg with loss of 1,593 people.
*In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands along the way).
*Later in 1919, a British airplane piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from Newfoundland to Ireland.
*In 1921, the [[United Kingdom|British]] were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an [[airship]].
*In 1922, the Portuguese were the first to cross the South Atlantic in an airship.
*The first transatlantic [[telephone]] call was made on [[January 7]], [[1927]].
*In 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). 
*In 1998, [[Ben Lecomte]] was the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean, stopping for only one week in the [[Azores]].
*After rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962 mi), on [[December 3]], [[1999]], [[Tori Murden]] became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by [[rowboat]] alone when she reached [[Guadeloupe]] from the [[Canary Islands]].

==Economy==
The ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it. Besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves and the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]]. The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of [[Newfoundland]], the shelf area off [[Nova Scotia]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the [[North Sea]], and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s have also been taken in great quantities. All these factors, taken together, tremendously enhance the Atlantic's great commercial value. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.

== Current environmental issues ==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], seals, [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and whales. [[Drift net]] fishing is killing [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the decline of fish stocks and contributing to international disputes. There is municipal sludge pollution off the eastern [[United States]], southern Brazil, and eastern [[Argentina]]; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, [[Lake Maracaibo]], Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

On [[June 7]], [[2006]], Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off of the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.
