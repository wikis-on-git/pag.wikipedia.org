==History==

On [[July 15]], [[1987]], Executive Order No. 220 was issued creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province. [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 6766 was passed on [[October 23]], [[1989]]. It provided for an Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. It mandates the creation of an autonomous government to be headed by a Regional Governor. It creates a Regional Assembly that will enact laws of regional application and a regional judiciary composed of a supreme court and lower courts. The act also directs the proposed autonomous government in the Cordillera to exercise governmental functions, including the raising of taxes, but excluding defense, foreign affairs and monetary functions. However, the Constitution requires that the act has to be ratified by the people in a plebiscite. It was originally scheduled on [[December 27]] of the same year but was reset to [[January 30]] the following by virtue of the Commission on Elections. During the said plebiscite, it was only Ifugao which voted favorably.

Republic Act No. 8438 dated [[December 22]], [[1997]] created the Cordillera Autonomous Region. In [[January]] [[1998]], a group of lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the act. A plebiscite held on March 9 of the same year was held and invalidated the act. The region was created but reduced to a regular administrative region.
