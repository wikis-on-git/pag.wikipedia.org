History[edit]
The show started in 1996 on GMA Network when Mel Tiangco transferred to the network. This was a direct result of the 1995 Tide commercial which had led to her exile from ABS-CBN together with Jay Sonza. The show had a successful run for almost seven years before its conclusion in 2004, when Jay Sonza became a senatorial candidate under Aksyon Demokratiko under the late Raul Roco coalition.

The program received various awards including Best Celebrity Talk Show in the PMPC Star Awards for Television.
