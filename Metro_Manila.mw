'''Metropolitan Manila''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Kalakhang Maynila'') or the '''National Capital Region (NCR)''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pambansang Punong Rehiyon'') is the capital of the [[Philippines]] and among the world's thirty [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan areas]]. Metro Manila is one of the two defined metropolitan areas in the Philippines, the other being [[Metro Cebu]].

Metro Manila is the [[metropolitan area]] that contains the city of [[Manila]], as well as sixteen surrounding cities and municipalities, including [[Quezon City]], the capital from [[1948]] to [[1976]].  Metro Manila is the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the Philippines, and is one of the more modern metropolises in Southeast Asia. Among locals, particularly those from Manila proper and those in the provinces, Metro Manila is often simply referred to as ''Manila''; however locals from other parts of the metropolis may see this as offensive, owing to city pride and also the fact that some cities are actually geographically closer to the neighboring provinces than to Manila itself. Metro Manila is often abbreviated as ''M.M.''.

Metro Manila is the smallest of the country's [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative regions]], but the most populous and the most densely populated, having a population of 9,932,560 (2000 [[census]]) in an area only 636 square kilometers large. It is also the only region without any [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]. The region is bordered by the provinces of [[Bulacan]] to the north, [[Rizal]] to the east, and [[Cavite]] and [[Laguna]] to the south. Metro Manila is also sandwiched by the [[Manila Bay]] to the west and the [[Laguna de Bay]] to the southeast with the [[Pasig River]] running between them, bisecting the region.

The term ''Metro Manila'' should not be confused with the [[metro]] rail system of the region, and the word ''metro'' itself always describes the metropolitan area (as in ''the metro''). The railways are called by their abbreviations, such as the LRT and the MRT, also known as Light Rail Transit and Metro Rail Transit, respectively.

On paper, [[Manila]] is the designated capital and seat of the Philippine government, but in practice, the seats of government are all around Metro Manila. The executive and administrative seat of government is located in Manila, so is the judiciary. The upper house of the legislature ([[Senate of the Philippines]]) is located in [[Pasay City]], and the lower house ([[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]) in [[Quezon City]].

==History==
Manila was first founded in [[June 24]], [[1571]] by three Spanish [[conquistadors]], led by [[Martín de Goiti]], [[Juan de Salcedo]] and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]]. In 1867, the Spanish Government of the Philippines founded the municipalities and territories south of the District of Morong in Nueva Ecija, north of the Province of Tondo and Imperial Manila, and isolated these from their mother province-Nueva Ecija. The Government created the Province of Manila composed of the Province of Tondo to the south and the isolated territories of Nueva Ecija to the north. The parts of Tondo were Navotas, Malabon, and Caloocan; and the parts of Nueva Ecija were Mariquina, Balintawak, Caloocan, Pasig, San Felipe Neri (presently called Makati), Las Piñas, what had been known as Paranaque, and Muntinlupa were combined to form the Province of Manila. The capital of the Province was [[Intramuros]], then itself called and considered to be Manila, a walled city located along the banks of Pasig River and Manila Bay in the present Manila. [[Image:Intramuros.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Intamuros, The Walled City of Manila, in 1932 before its destruction in 1945.]][[Image:Makati78.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A portion of the Makati Central Business District]] In 1897, while the Imperial City of Manila is being prepared for industrialization, most houses in Tondo were demolished to give way to railroad construction. One of those whose house was demolished was Andres Bonifacio, the founder of the Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (Supreme and Revered Union of the Children of the Nation) or KKK, a secret organization which aimed towards independence and self-governance away from the Spanish government. In 1896, the Cry of Balintawak was initiated, an event which denounces the Spanish authority by tearing their ''cedulas'' or residence tax slips. On December 30, 1896, [[Jose Rizal]], the Philippine National Hero, was executed by the Spanish government in Bagumbayan, an execution site near Intramuros. This event led to the Filipino uprising against Spain. Likewise, The Province of Manila was the 8th and last Province to revolt against Spain paving the establishment of the Federated Philippine Republics (composed of [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Pampanga]], [[Bulacan]], [[Tarlac]], [[Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Cavite]] and Manila). The Province remained in existence until 1901, when its territory was subdivided by the Americans. 

In [[1901]], the Philippine Assembly created the City of Manila composed of the Municipalities of Ermita, [[Intramuros]] or Imperial City of Manila, [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[Sta. Ana, Manila|Sta. Ana]], [[San Nicolas]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Port, Manila|Port Area]], [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Binondo, Manila|Binondo]] and others. Some Assemblymen included the municipalities of Caloocan, Marikina, Pasig, Parañaque, Malabon, Navotas, San Juan, Makati, Mandaluyong (San Felipe Neri), Las Piñas, Muntinglupa and Taguig-Pateros to a new province named Rizal. The capital of the province was Pasig.

In [[1976]], owing a great respect to the history of Manila, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Presidential Decree 824, creating the Metropolitan Manila Area. The site of the old province of Manila can no longer be used for agricultural purposes and therefore the term 'province' is not applicable. The decree seceded the 12 municipalities and 2 cities of Rizal, the municipality of Valenzuela in Bulacan, Quezon City and Manila.  The Metropolitan Manila Commission is created to administer the emerging metropolis. Marcos appointed his wife [[Imelda Marcos]] as governor of Metro Manila.

In [[1986]], after a major government reorganization, President [[Corazon Aquino]] issued Executive Order No. 392 and changed the structure of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to Metropolitan Manila Authority. Metro Manila Mayors chose from themselves as chair of the agency. 

In [[1995]], through Republic Act 7924, Metro Manila Authority was reorganized and became the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]. The chair of the agency is appointed by the President and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor.

==Cities and municipalities==
Metro Manila is composed of fourteen [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] and three [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]]. Each is governed by a mayor who belongs to the Metro Manila Mayor's League, which is part of the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA).

<small>'''¹''' 2000 Census</small>

Unlike other regions which are divided into [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR) is divided into four nonfunctioning districts, which are grouped according to geographical basis in reference to the [[Pasig River]]. These districts were created in 1976 but have no local government and no congressional representation, in contrast to that of the provinces. These districts are used mostly for fiscal and statistical purposes. 

The cities and municipalities within the NCR are grouped into the four districts as follows:

*'''1st District:''' City of [[Manila]]
*'''2nd District:''' [[Mandaluyong City]], [[Marikina City]], [[Pasig City]], [[Quezon City]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]
*'''3rd District:''' [[Caloocan City]], [[Malabon City]], [[Navotas]], [[Valenzuela City]]
*'''4th District:''' [[Las Piñas City]], [[Makati City]], [[Muntinlupa City]], [[Parañaque City]], [[Pasay City]], [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]], [[Taguig City]]

==Economy==
[[Image:Rockwellcenter87.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rockwell Center in Makati]]


===Business districts===
[[Makati City]] is widely acknowledged as the financial capital of the country where one can find the Makati Central Business District (CBD). Interesting landmarks in Makati's Central Business District include [[Ayala Center]], composed of [[Glorietta]] and [[Greenbelt]], [[Ayala Museum]], and [[Yuchengco Museum]]. Also in Makati is Rockwell Center. Most multi-national company offices and embassies in the Philippines are situated in Makati. Also posing as a competitor for a vibrant business center are Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Eastwood City in Quezon City, Ortigas Center in Pasig City, Manila Bay City Reclamation Area in the cities of Pasay, Parañaque and Las Piñas, and Alabang Estates and Madrigal Business Park in Muntinlupa.

===Shopping centers===
Metro Manila currently has a large number of malls in the [[Philippines]], and the largest of these is the [[SM Mall of Asia]] in the Pasay City reclamation area. Before the Mall of Asia was completed, the largest was [[SM Megamall]] in Ortigas Center. 

Other shopping centers in Ortigas Center include Robinson's Galleria, Shangri-la Plaza, and The Podium. 

Recently opened in Pasig is a new development called Frontera Verde, which currently hosts Tiendesitas, a tiangge-style shopping center. Soon to rise are a new SM development as well as several other malls.
In the Central Business District of Makati, the [[Ayala Center]] hosts other malls, including Glorietta and the upscale Greenbelt shopping districts. Also in Makati is the Rockwell Center. These places are frequented by members of Metro Manila's upper classes.

Taguig City has a mall named ''Market-Market!'', which is strategically located in a transportation hub within [[Fort Bonifacio]] Global City. 

In the City of Manila, the largest malls include SM City Manila and Robinson's Place-Ermita. 

Cubao is [[Quezon City]]'s Central Commercial Area that hosts 5 malls that includes the ultra-modern Gateway Mall. Other malls include various SM chains in the metropolis. Aside from Cubao, there is also Eastwood City, located along Libis.

Metro Manila has a lot of markets, locally called ''palengke''. One of these are the Central Market, located in Quiapo district of Manila, and Divisoria Market, also in Manila. Cloverleaf Market in Balintawak, Quezon City supplies most of Metro Manila's fruit and vegetable products. Navotas Port Market supplies most of Metro Manila's fish products.  Other smaller markets include the markets of Cubao Farmers, Nepa-Q Mart, Muñoz, Balingasa, Galas, Santa Mesa, Novaliches Talipapa, Baclaran, Pasay Libertad, and Pasay Cartimar, the latter also being one of the finest pet markets in the Philippines.

Midway between a mall and a market are the Philippine-only ''tiangge''s, or airconditioned markets selling goods such as clothes, shoes, accessories, computer parts, mobile phones, CDs, VCDs, MP3s, iPods, and DVDs. Among these can be found in [[Greenhills Shopping Center]] in the municipality of San Juan and St. Francis Square in Mandaluyong City.

===Wealth extremes===
[[Image:Malateskylinemanilabay.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manila Bay]]
[[Image:HPIM2166.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Greenbelt Park, at the heart of Makati CBD, where al fresco cafés and restaurants are situated]]
Metro Manila is a place of economic extremes. Most of the wealthy and upper-middle class in the country reside within [[gated communities]] in places such as [[Forbes Park]], [[Dasmariñas Village]], [[Bel-Air Village]], and Urdaneta Village in Makati, [[Loyola Heights]], La Vista Subdivision, Corinthian Gardens, Greenmeadows, Multinational Village in Paranaque, Capitol Hills District, [[Ayala Heights]], Filinvest 1 and 2, Baranggay South Triangle, Baranggay West Triangle, New Manila, Blue Ridge, St. Ignatius Village, East Fairview Park and [[White Plains]] of [[Quezon City]], Valle Verde Village of Pasig City, Greenhills in San Juan, and Ayala Alabang in [[Muntinlupa City]]. Other wealthy families opt to live urban lifestyles and instead own large apartments and condominium units such as those in the Rockwell Center in Makati and the Fort Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. That the area is populated by many of the wealthiest people in the country has also driven up the real estate value of the properties in these areas such that they are unmatched anywhere else.

However, practically side-by-side with the residences of Metro Manila's elite are slums and squattered areas, most of which are in the outskirts of the aforementioned gated communities, as well as areas left behind by the rapid development of the rest of Metro Manila, such as Tondo and Sampaloc in Manila, Guadalupe in Makati, some parts of Marikina, Caloocan, and Valenzuela, and most parts of Navotas. Highway roadsides are often crowded with corrugated-steel-roofed huts and straw markets by which livelihood is obtained, in a stark contrast to the gated subdivisions present in Metro Manila. Less than 10% of the population actually live in the aformentioned neighborhoods, while the rest live in non-gated (normal) neighborhoods in regular houses, apartments, tenements and shacks. 

Metro Manila is also characterized by a very large middle class group scattered throughout the metropolis. The middle-class group in Metro Manila enjoys much more spending power, access to education, and far better living qualities than the quite numerous poverty-stricken people that migrate to Metro Manila from the provinces.

==Recreation==

[[Image:Pic_rizalpark.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rizal Monument at Rizal Park]] 
[[Image:Manila - Intramuros.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A Colonial House in Intramuros]]
[[Image:Manila - Manila Bay.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Manila Bay Sunset]]
Located west of Metro Manila, [[Rizal Park]] is the reference point for all kilometer points in the island of [[Luzon]] and the Philippines. Rizal Park features the statue of the Philippine National Hero [[Jose Rizal]], as well as several Philippine flags, a gigantic relief map of the Philippines, scenic Chinese gardens, and the several government offices, such as the Department of Tourism. On the seaside front of Rizal Park are numerous seafood restaurants specializing in Filipino and Asian cuisine. The National Museum of the Filipino People can be also found here. It is a complex of two Greco-Roman buildings which house ancient relics, native mummies, natural treasures and factual galleries about the Philippines and other countries. The museum also boasts a vast collection of artworks and masterpieces crafted by Filipinos which were commended by the [[Louvre]] Museum per se. Similarly, part of the museum complex is the first planetarium in Southeast Asia.  Also located here is the [[Quirino Grandstand]], which apart from the regular ''miting de avance'' (Spanish: political gatherings), is also a popular rendezvous of various religious groups, such as [[El Shaddai]] and other popular American-based Protestant movements, such as [[Benny Hinn]] International Ministries. 

Near the Rizal Park is a 400-year-old Imperial City known as Intramuros, a walled domain which was once the seat of government during the Spanish Colonial Era and Mid-American Periods. Among the attractions are the Fort Santiago, a timeworn Spanish military fortress which was also the cell for the national hero, Jose Rizal in [[1896]]; Casa Manila, a Spanish colonial villa which is converted into a house gallery; Manila Cathedral, the official seat of the Archbishop of Manila; San Agustin Church, the oldest existing church/building in the Philippines that survived the wars and earthquakes of Manila since [[1587]]; Intramuros Golf Club, a prime golf course outside the walls; and the Clam Shell Tent, an exhibition center of the Department of Tourism. Horse-carriages and tourist buses are also some of the attractions. The rest also includes a walk above the walls surrounding Intramuros, government offices, universities and colonial houses.

Fort Bonifacio, or FB, is the location of military detachments, cemeteries, International schools, and world-class dining and shopping facilities. Other local recreation areas include the Nayong Pilipino (Philippine Village) in Parañague City, Quezon City Memorial Circle and Ninoy Aquino Wildlife Center, both located in Diliman district of Quezon City, the posh Greenbelt Center, located in Makati City, the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex and Bay City, both located in Pasay City. Meanwhile, the Paco Park, Arroceros Botanical Garden, Manila Zoo, Plaza Rajah Sulayman, Plaza Miranda, new Rizal Avenue Bargain Walkway, the all-steel Gothic Church of San Sebastian, the bars and night clubs of Ermita and Malate districts and the famous Roxas Boulevard Bay Walk which offers a fine view of the legendary Manila Bay sunset and hip-dining of Asian, Western and Filipino cuisine, are all located in Manila.

==Transportation==
{{seealso|Transportation in the Philippines}}

===Roadways===
{{main|Major roads in Metro Manila}}

[[Image:Nlew8.jpg|450px|thumb|right|The [[North Luzon Expressway]], one of the major roads out of Metro Manila]]
The metropolis has an extensive system of highways connecting the various cities and municipalities. The major roads include ten radial roads, which branch out from central [[Manila]] and five circumferential roads which form a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around downtown Manila. Most of these roads are very important transportation arteries. One is the C-4 (Circumferential Road 4), also called [[EDSA|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] or more popularly as EDSA. It is the major thoroughfare in Metro Manila connecting five cities in Metro Manila, namely Pasay, Makati, Mandaluyong, Quezon City, and Caloocan. Some other important roads are R-1 (Radial Road 1) ([[Roxas Boulevard]] and [[Manila-Cavite Expressway]]) connecting to [[Cavite]] province in the southwest; R-3 or the [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) connecting to [[Laguna province]] in the southeast; R-6 (Aurora Boulevard and Marcos Highway) connecting to [[Rizal]] province in the east; and R-8 or the [[North Luzon Expressway]] (NLEX) connecting to [[Bulacan]] province in the north. One of its newest roads, the [[Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard]], running on the [[Land reclamation|reclamation area]] parallel to R-1, is one of the destinations of Manila's elite.

Metro Manila is notorious for its traffic jams. A trip that should take 20 minutes will last an hour or more especially during rush hour. Consequently, the [[Metro Manila Development Authority]] (see section below) has constructed many projects to decongest traffic. 

Such projects of the MMDA for motorists are the construction of [[flyover]]s (elevated roads), [[Road junction|interchanges]], ''loading bays'' for Public Utility Vehicles (PUVs), ''emergency bays'', and ''U-Turn slots'' over various intersections and thoroughfares, and the completion of the comprehensive railway system (see below). It has also been engaged in road widening with the support of the Department of Public Works and Highways. MMDA has also utilized projects for the pedestrians such as the installation of footbridges, waiting sheds, and men's urinals to various roads in the metropolis. The agency has also implemented various schemes for motorists such as the Uniform Vehicular Volume Reduction Scheme (UVRRS), more popularly known as "color coding", where vehicles whose plate numbers end in different digits are banned from traveling on different days, the Yellow Lane scheme, where yellow-plated PUBs (Public Utility Buses) will only use the two outermost lanes in EDSA, and the Organized Bus Route (OBR) for Metro Manila.

===Railways===

[[Image:megatren.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Almost all of the rail lines in Metro Manila are elevated such as this LRT 2 (Purple Line) Train passing along its tracks.]]

{{main|Manila Light Rail Transit System|Manila Metro Rail Transit System|Philippine National Railways}}

[[As of 2005]], there are two different [[rapid transit]] systems in Metro Manila: the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]], or the LRT, and the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System]], or the MRT.  The [[Manila LRT Yellow Line|Yellow Line]] (LRT-1) and the [[Manila LRT Purple Line|Purple Line]] (MRT-2) form the LRT network, while the Blue Line (MRT-3) forms the MRT network, with [[List of Strong Republic Transit System stations#List of LRT stations|29 stations]] on the LRT and [[List of Strong Republic Transit System stations#List of MRT stations|13 stations]] on the MRT .  Four more lines are [[Manila Light Rail Transit System#Future expansion|proposed]] and would connect Metro Manila to the provinces of [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Laguna province|Laguna]] and [[Rizal]] upon their completion.

[[Philippine National Railways]] also operates two main-line railway lines within Metro Manila, all part of the once-flourshing Luzon railway system.  The northern line, known as Northrail and connecting [[Manila]] to [[Caloocan City]], is currently closed.  Line extensions are proposed to [[Valenzuela City]] and further on to Bulacan and [[Pampanga]].  The trans-Metro Manila portion of the still-open southern line, known as Southrail, commences at Tutuban station in [[Tondo, Manila]], passes through the cities of Manila, [[Makati City|Makati]], [[Taguig City|Taguig]], [[Parañaque City|Parañaque]] and [[Las Piñas City|Las Piñas]], and ends in Barangay Buli, [[Muntinlupa City]], before entering the province of Laguna.

===Airports===
The country's main airport is the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] (NAIA) which straddles the boundary between [[Parañaque City]] and [[Pasay City]]. It presently consists of two terminals, while a third one will open soon. There is also a separate domestic terminal.  There are two main runways and the hangar of [[Philippine Airlines]] is located near the [[Villamor Air Base]].

[[Image:Naia3.jpg|250px|thumb|right|NAIA Terminal 3]]

There are four airport terminals in Metro Manila, all of which are located in Parañaque City, 9 kilometers south of the City of Manila.

*'''NAIA-1''': NAIA-1 is the original terminal and was constructed in 1981. The 67,000 square meter terminal was designed by Filipino architect Leandro V. Locsin and has a design capacity of 4.5 million passengers per year. It currently serves all non-Philippine Airlines international flights. The terminal has reached capacity in 1991 and has been over capacity ever since.
*'''NAIA-2''': NAIA-2 terminal was finished in 1998 and is named the Centennial Terminal since 1998 was the centennial year of the declaration of Philippine independence. The 75,000 square meter terminal was originally designed by Aéroports de Paris to be a domestic terminal, but the design was later modified to accommodate international flights. It has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year in its international wing and 5 million in its domestic wing, which later will expand to nine million passengers yearly. Terminal 2 is the home of Philippine Airlines and Air Philippines and is used for both its domestic and international flights since it has the most flights out of the NAIA terminals.
*'''NAIA-3''': NAIA-3 was approved for construction in 1997 and is nearly complete. The modern US$500 million, 189,000 square meter facility was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) to have a capacity of 13 million passengers per year. However, a legal dispute between the government of the Philippines and the project's main contractor, PIATCO, over alleged anomalies in the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract, is holding completion and opening of the terminal. On December 2004, the Philippine Government took over the management of the facility through an order of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court (RTC). Manila International Airport Authority is due to announce its opening in the mid-2006.
*'''Domestic Airport''': The Domestic Airport was built on 1948 on the old Airport Road. It currently handles all domestic air traffic, excluding Philippine Airlines and Air Philippines. Currently, the terminal is composed of two single-story buildings and serves the domestic flights of other local carriers, which are Cebu Pacific, Asian Spirit, Southeast Asian Airlines (Seair), Laoag International Airlines and Interisland Airlines.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Ci_mla_cathedral.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manila Cathedral.]]
As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 9,932,560 people and 2,132,989 households residing in Metro Manila. With a population density of 15,617/km², it is by far the most densely populated region of the Philippines. For the period 1995 to 2000, the annual population growth rate was 1.06 percent, lower than that of the 1990 to 1995 period (3.30 percent). If the current annual population growth rate of the metropolitan area continues, the population is expected to double in 65 years.

The most common language spoken in households is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (94.34%). [[English language|English]] is widely understood.

The large majority of the population of Metro Manila is [[Roman Catholic]] (89.10%). Other religions include [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (2.89%), [[Evangelicalism]] (1.64%), and Islam (0.60%).<ref name="2000census">[http://www.census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2003/pr0312tx.html National Capital Region: Close to 10 million persons], National Statistics Office.</ref>

==Education==

Metro Manila is home to several noteworthy Philippine higher educational institutions such as [[Adamson University]], [[Arellano University]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[Assumption College]], [[Centro Escolar University]], the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], [[De La Salle Philippines|De La Salle University]] {[[De La Salle-Araneta University|Araneta]], [[De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde|College of Saint Benilde]], [[De La Salle University-Manila]], [[Emilio Aguinaldo College]], [[Far Eastern University]], [[FEATI University]], [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]], [[Mapua Institute of Technology]], [[Miriam College]],   the [[Our Lady of Fatima University]],   the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]], [[Philippine Normal University]], [[Philippine Women's University]], [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]], [[San Beda College]], the [[University of Asia and the Pacific]], the [[University of the East]], [[Saint Pedro Poveda College]], [[University of Manila]], the [[University of the Philippines]] {both the [[University of the Philippines, Diliman|Diliman]] and [[University of the Philippines, Manila|Manila]] campuses}, and the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

Metro Manila is also home to numerous public and private basic education institutions, science high schools, and international schools. 

Every year, thousands of students from the various countries of Asia, such as China, Japan, Korea, Iran and Vietnam, and even from Europe go to the Philippines to study.

==Police and security==
[[Image:Wbphillipines.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Riot police block anti-Arroyo protesters near the Philippine Congress]]

It is transmitted by the state-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) through high tension wires. It is stored and distributed by the [[Manila Electric Company]] (Meralco), the only company allowed to distribute electricity to the metropolis.

Metro Manila's tap water is sourced from the Angat Dam in [[Norzagaray]], [[Bulacan]]. It is stored in the Novaliches Reservoir and filtered in the La Mesa Dam, both in northeast Quezon City. Metro Manila's water distribution and sewerage system used to be managed by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System (MWSS), a state-owned company. In 1997, MWSS awarded concessionare licenses to two private corporations.
