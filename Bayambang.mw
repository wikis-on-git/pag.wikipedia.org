'''Bayambang''' is a 2nd class [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in the [[Philippine province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the [[2000]] census, it has a population of 96,609 people in 17,897 households.

Bayambang is bounded on the north by Malasiqui, on the south by Camiling, on the east by Bautista, and on the west by Urbiztondo. Bayambang is the farthest town south of the province of Pangasinan.

The name of this town according to the legend, came from the name of a plant called "balangbang" which grew in abundance during the early days. The verdant hills of Bayambang were almost covered by these plants. The people made pickles out of them. As years passed by, these plants became extinct in the vicinity, but the name "Bayambang" which sounds like an echo of the plant's name, was retained and was given to designate this town.

Others believed that the name of the town came from the once numerous "Culibangbang" tress (these trees are growing on the hills of Bayambang and at present we can still find some of them). It was said that when the Spaniards first came to this town they asked some natives what this place was called. The people thought the Spaniards were asking about the trees, and so they answered "culibangbang." The Spaniards thought it was "Bayambang" and hence forth they called the town by that name. 

The town of Bayambang is in the central part of Southern Pangasinan . The town got its name from a plant called “Balambang” which grew in abundance in the place during the olden days. The hilly portions on the southern part were almost covered by these plants, which was noted for making salad. As years passed by, theses plants became extinct in the vicinity but not before the town was named after it by changing its letter L to letter Y, hence the name of BAYAMBANG.

Bayambang in the early days had a big territorial coverage. The municipality of Bautista , Alcala, Sto. Tomas, Rosales, Paniqui, Gerona and Camiling of the province of Tarlac were once part of the old Bayambang. Today, however, its size has been considerably reduced after the aforementioned municipalities attained municipal status. Bayambang is at present bound4ed by the following municipalities on the north by Basista and Malasiqui; on the east by Bautista; on the south by Camiling, Tarlac, and on the west by Urbiztondo.

According to the records obtained from the “Awarans” of our old folks, the late Benaldo Gutierrez and the late Honorato Carungay, and also from the testimonies of some of their contemporaries, Bayambang was founded in the early sixteenth century by an Aeta known as Agalet. In its early founding, the Aita founder led in forming the town by organizing his own tribe. He formed barangays composed of small villages. The town was first located in what is now barrio Inirangan and Hermosa and later on moved to the barrio of Telbang and part of southern Poblacion just at the old Spanish Catholic Cemetery which is better known as the Old Bayambang. The old Municipal building was found near the public market until finally moved to its present location.

Bayambang is a historic town. It stands with enduring pride as the first town in Pangasinan to experience disastrous and terrifying events that occurred in the province.

It was in Bayambang where the first Juez de Cuchillo sowed horror in 1897. Many of the prominent men of the town were executed and many of the houses were razed to the ground. It was through the intervention of a Spanish-Filipino General which ended the inhuman torture during those days.

The lyrics of the Philippine Anthem were written by Jose Palma in Bautista once part of the old Bayambang.

By early November 1899, President Emilio Aguinaldo made Bayambang his temporary capital in Pangasinan. Bayambang became the last seat of our short-lived Philippine Republic when the American forces of Gen. Arthur MacArthur captured Tarlac on October 12, 1899 , that's when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo moved the capital to Bayambang until November 13, 1899 , when he marched on to Isabela. At the now defunct railroad station of Bayambang located at the north end of Rizal Avenue, the town's main artery way before barrio Tambac (this area is currently called the “Estacion”), Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo encountered the Spanish Forces during the revolution.

Our national hero, Jose P. Rizal had for a number of times visited Camiling because of his love for Leonor Rivera. Camiling was then a part of Bayambang. Gen. Antonio Luna and his brave men once established camp in Bayambang while fleeing from the “ “Krag “ welding American cavalry.

At the railroad station of Bayambang, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo encountered the Spanish Forces during the revolution.

Bayambang during the Japanese Regime was made the capital of Pangasinan when Dr. Diaz was appointed Governor by the Japanese Imperial Government, Dr. Diaz held his Provincial Administration Office in Bayambang at the still existing residence of the late Eulogio Dauz, at the junction of Quezon Blvd. And M.H. Del Pilar streets.

During the war, three bombs were dropped by the Japanese at Roman Catholic Church of Bayambang. The bombs did not explode something miraculous to reckon with.

Bayambang became the first Pilot Town in the Far East when it was chosen to be the seat of the famed UNESCO NATIONAL COMMUNITY TRAINING CENTER . This made Bayambang the Educational show window of the Philippines in the Far East as waves of Educational dignitaries from all over the country as well as from other countries come to town to attend educational workshops and seminars.

The first Executive of the town under the Spanish Regime was Vicente Cayabyab who held the office of Gobernadorcillo. In 1892, Mauricio de Guzman became the first Cabeza de Barangay (Captain of the Municipality). He was succeeded by Honorato Carungay, Lorenzo Rodriguez and Julian Mananzan. During the revolutionary period, Saturnino Junio was appointed as the Chief Executive. And when the American Military Government was inaugurated, Evaristo Dimalanta was appointed President.

When the CIVIL Government was inaugurated, Lauriano Roldan was appointed as the first President of the town under such government. He was succeeded by Alvino Garcia, Mateo Mananzan, Gavino de Guzman, Marciano Fajardo, Agustin Carungay, Emeterio Camacho, and Enrique M. Roldan.
