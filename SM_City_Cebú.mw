==Historiya==
The mall first opened in November 1993, and was seen as catering to the low and middle class of shoppers, in contrast to its upmarket competitor, Ayala Center Cebu which opened a few months later.<ref name=inq/> An expansion wing that particularly targeted upper class customers was added in 2007. As of 2009, the mall has undergone major renovations. Expansion plans with a hotel and convention center are being developed. More shops are being proposed in 2012.
