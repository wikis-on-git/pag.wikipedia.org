==Historiya==

During the Spanish period, the municipality was only a component barrio of Gapan. When San Isidro became a town and was separated from Gapan, Jaen and San Antonio became one of its component barrios. When San Antonio became a town and became separated from San Isidro, Jaen became one of its component barrios. In June 18, 1865, Jaen became a town and was separated from San Antonio thru the initiative of two early leaders of this town - Kabesang Prudencio Esquivel and Kapitan Antonio Embuscado. Jaen is now 137 years old. When still part of the town of San Antonio, Jaen was then called San Agustin. And because there were many people in Langla, a river-port, San Agustin became a center of trade. Later Jaen became a town and San Agustin became the patron saint. 

The name Jaen was given in honor of then Spain's Governor-General Jose Maria Camba, who lived in the [[Jaén, Spain|Spanish city of Jaén]]. In coordination with Padre Estanislao B. Moso, Kabesang Prudencio and Kapitan Antonio became also the first leaders. They led the establishing of the first Catholic Church of Jaen which is now the Parish Church of San Agustin. Jaen is in Central Luzon, in the southern part of Nueva Ecija. Jaen is about 100-km. distant from Manila if one is to travel the old Cagayan Valley Road. There are however other road networks connecting Jaen to Nueva Viscaya, Isabela in the North, and to the West - Pampanga, to Olangapo or Bataan. In the olden days, Pampanga River was once the only and the fastest way of transportation used during the Spanish times in going to Manila and other places and boundaries.

In 1865, Jaen was merely a part of San Antonio, known with its old name "Ibayong Ilog". When the place showed improvements and its population grew to no less than 5,000 people it became a town through a petition filed by the inhabitants. The Spanish officials signed the papers granting the petition that "Ibayong Ilog" be a town in Factoria (San Isidro) which was then the capital of Nueva Ecija.

The declaration was brought to the Governor General in Manila, which afterwards was submitted to the Vice General of the Philippines in the person of Father Gregorio Martinez. Father Martinez marked this approved but furtherly wrote his wish, changing the name "Ibayong Ilog" to the name of the place of his birth in Spain, the town of Jaen.

On August 24, 1896, its people revolted against the Spaniards and on September of the same year, armed with bolos and spears, ambushed and killed forty (40) Spanish soldiers in Lumanas (now a Sitio of Brgy. Sto. Tomas South of this municipality). This successful attack made Lumanas a historical site and was called "Pinagtambangan". A marker was erected in this place now as a beautiful reminder of this heroic feat.

Kapitan dela Cruz was the first head of the community, who was succeeded by Kapitan Apolinario Esquivel. Later on, a municipal president was elected.

Several prominent personalities have partaken of the leadership in the community. They have done their best to have the present status of Jaen which is now under the administration of Mayor [[Santy R. Austria]].

==Ekonomiya==

Most of the Northwestern section of the municipality are planted to palay. Rice production is the main source of living of the populace. Twenty (20) barangays of Jaen are fully irrigated. About 80% of the land is suited for rice production, this covers an area of a little less than 9,500 hectares.

Mango plantations are found in the Southern portion of the municipality. Based on the latest survey, 584 hectares are utilized for mango production. This includes backyard mango farms. Ten percent (10%) of the total agricultural area is planted to vegetables.

In the urban area, mostly in the Poblacion and nearby barangays, several establishments have sprouted. These include agricultural supply traders, dry goods stores, hard wares, groceries and eateries. The public market is in the area.

Among the service businesses in the area are pawnshops, auto and motorcycle parts and service, computer repair shops, internet café, tailoring and dress shops and rural banks.

Distilled and purified water processors, mobile phone card dealers, cable and landline telephone businesses are also present in the municipality.

Professional services of doctors, accountants, dentists, lawyers and engineers are also prevalent in the town.Most of the unemployed and out of school youths are given employment by private contractors and the local government unit in doing manual jobs as construction workers and street sweepers.
