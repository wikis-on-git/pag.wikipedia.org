Today, there are approximately between 1.5 to 2.5 million members in forty five countries. The church is an offshoot of the Pentecostal branch of Christianity that emerged during the early twentieth century. The church also adheres to Oneness Pentecostal theology (Jesus-Name doctrine). The church was established in the [[Filipinas]] since 1983. They aim to preach the gospel to all nations before the Second Coming of Jesus.
