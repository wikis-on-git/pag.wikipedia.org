She was born and raised in [[Siyudad na Poughkeepsie (Balon Iorke|Poughkeepsie, New York]],<ref name="robins"/> and travelled to [[Palo Alto, California]] in 1963 with her older brother Don shortly after she was expelled from high school. In early 1964, Garcia met [[Neal Cassady]], who introduced her to [[Ken Kesey]] and his friends, one of whom gave her the name "Mountain Girl".  Cassady took her to [[La Honda, California]], Kesey's base of operations, where she quickly joined the inner circle of Pranksters and became romantically involved with Kesey, having a daughter by him named Sunshine.<ref name="kool-aid">Wolfe, Tom. (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''.  Farrar, Straus and Giroux.</ref>  The [[Grateful Dead]] song "Here Comes Sunshine" may or may not be an allusion to Garcia's and Kesey's daughter &ndash; the Dead were fond of lyrics having double, often personal meanings.  When Kesey was a fugitive, Garcia had a relationship with another Prankster named George Walker who would become her husband in 1966. The marriage between Garcia and Walker did not last long and they separated in December 1966 and were divorced in 1978.  She took up with Jerry Garcia after splitting with Walker, but they did not marry for many years after.
  
Before marrying Jerry Garcia in 1981, they had two daughters.<ref name="robins">Robins, Cynthia.
