Kevin Balot lives in a beki world. At first I thought he was really a girl by his looks and awesome beauty but I have known that he is fucking gay and a trans-gender.
He shouln't be in pageants for girls. 
He deserves to be in a gay pageant. It's very irritating for those true girls who lose in the pageant with him.

Why don't he join in the pageant that's truly for him.

He's not a crap.

He just have to deal with his own world and face the reality .
